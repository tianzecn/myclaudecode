With 10 billion activated parameters (230 billion total), it delivers near-frontier intelligence across general reasoning, tool use, and multi-step task execution while maintaining low latency and deployment efficiency.\n\nThe model excels in code generation, multi-file editing, compile-run-fix loops, and test-validated repair, showing strong results on SWE-Bench Verified, Multi-SWE-Bench, and Terminal-Bench. It also performs competitively in agentic evaluations such as BrowseComp and GAIA, effectively handling long-horizon planning, retrieval, and recovery from execution errors.\n\nBenchmarked by [Artificial Analysis](https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/minimax-m2), MiniMax-M2 ranks among the top open-source models for composite intelligence, spanning mathematics, science, and instruction-following. Its small activation footprint enables fast inference, high concurrency, and improved unit economics, making it well-suited for large-scale agents, developer assistants, and reasoning-driven applications that require responsiveness and cost efficiency.\n\nTo avoid degrading this model's performance, MiniMax highly recommends preserving reasoning between turns.

The Instruct model targets general vision-language use (VQA, document parsing, chart/table extraction, multilingual OCR). The series emphasizes robust perception (recognition of diverse real-world and synthetic categories), spatial understanding (2D/3D grounding), and long-form visual comprehension, with competitive results on public multimodal benchmarks for both perception and reasoning.\n\nBeyond analysis, Qwen3-VL supports agentic interaction and tool use: it can follow complex instructions over multi-image, multi-turn dialogues; align text to video timelines for precise temporal queries; and operate GUI elements for automation tasks. The models also enable visual coding workflows—turning sketches or mockups into code and assisting with UI debugging—while maintaining strong text-only performance comparable to the flagship Qwen3 language models. This makes Qwen3-VL suitable for production scenarios spanning document AI, multilingual OCR, software/UI assistance, spatial/embodied tasks, and research on vision-language agents.",
