# Comprehensive Summary: All Grok (xAI) Issues

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-11
**Status**: Active Research & Mitigation
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Grok mostly unusable for tool-heavy workflows through OpenRouter

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Grok models (x-ai/grok-code-fast-1, x-ai/grok-4) have **multiple protocol incompatibilities** when used through OpenRouter with Claude Code. While we've fixed 2 out of 3 issues on our side, fundamental OpenRouter/xAI problems remain.

**Bottom Line:** Grok is **NOT RECOMMENDED** for Claude Code until OpenRouter/xAI fix tool calling issues.

---

## 📋 All Known Issues

### ✅ ISSUE #1: Visible Reasoning Field (FIXED)

**Problem:** Grok sends reasoning in `delta.reasoning` instead of `delta.content`
**Impact:** UI shows no progress during reasoning
**Fix:** Check both `delta.content || delta.reasoning` (line 786 in proxy-server.ts)
**Status:** ✅ Fixed in commit eb75cf6
**File:** GROK_REASONING_PROTOCOL_ISSUE.md

---

### ✅ ISSUE #2: Encrypted Reasoning Causing UI Freeze (FIXED)

**Problem:** Grok uses `reasoning_details` with encrypted reasoning when `reasoning` is null
**Impact:** 2-5 second UI freeze, appears "done" when still processing
**Evidence:** 186 encrypted reasoning chunks ignored → 5+ second UI freeze
**Fix:** Detect encrypted reasoning + adaptive ping (1s interval)
**Status:** ✅ Fixed in commit 408e4a2
**File:** GROK_ENCRYPTED_REASONING_ISSUE.md

**Code Fix:**
```typescript
// Detect encrypted reasoning
const hasEncryptedReasoning = delta?.reasoning_details?.some(
  (detail: any) => detail.type === "reasoning.encrypted"
);

// Update activity timestamp
if (textContent || hasEncryptedReasoning) {
  lastContentDeltaTime = Date.now();
}

// Adaptive ping every 1 second if quiet for >1 second
```

### ⚠️ ISSUE #3: xAI XML Function Call Format (PARTIALLY FIXED)

**Problem:** Grok outputs `<xai:function_call>` XML as text instead of proper `tool_calls` JSON
**Impact:** Claude Code UI stuck, tools don't execute, shows literal XML
**Evidence:** Log shows `<xai:function_call>` sent as `delta.content` (text)
**Our Fix:** Inject system message forcing OpenAI format
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY FIXED - Our workaround may not always work
**File:** GROK_XAI_FUNCTION_CALL_FORMAT_ISSUE.md

**Our Workaround (commit f3e...)**:
```typescript
// For Grok models, inject system message
if (model.includes("grok") || model.includes("x-ai/")) {
  if (tools.length > 0) {
    messages.unshift({
      role: "system",
      content: "IMPORTANT: Use OpenAI tool_calls format with JSON. NEVER use XML format like <xai:function_call>."
    });
  }
}
```

**Why Partial:** This may not work if:
- Grok ignores the instruction
- OpenRouter strips system messages
- xAI API has deeper issues

---

### ❌ ISSUE #4: Missing "created" Field (UPSTREAM - NOT FIXABLE BY US)

**Problem:** OpenRouter returns errors from xAI without required "created" field
**Impact:** Parsing errors in many clients (Zed, Cline, Claude Code)
**Evidence:**
- Zed Issue #37022: "missing field `created`"
- Zed Issue #36994: "Tool calls don't work in openrouter"
- Zed Issue #34185: "Grok 4 tool calls error"
**Status:** ❌ UPSTREAM ISSUE - Can't fix in our proxy
**Workaround:** None - Must wait for OpenRouter/xAI fix

---

### ❌ ISSUE #5: Tool Calls Completely Broken (UPSTREAM - NOT FIXABLE BY US)

**Problem:** Grok Code Fast 1 won't answer with tool calls unless "Minimal" mode
**Impact:** Tool calling broken across multiple platforms
**Evidence:**
- VAPI: "x-ai/grok-3-beta fails with tool call"
- Zed: "won't answer anything unless using Minimal mode"
- Home Assistant: Integration broken
**Status:** ❌ UPSTREAM ISSUE - OpenRouter/xAI problem
**Workaround:** Use different model

---

### ❌ ISSUE #6: "Invalid Grammar Request" Errors (UPSTREAM - NOT FIXABLE BY US)

**Problem:** xAI rejects structured output requests with 502 errors
**Impact:** Random failures with "Upstream error from xAI: undefined"
**Evidence:** Multiple reports of 502 errors with "Invalid grammar request"
**Status:** ❌ UPSTREAM ISSUE - xAI API bug
**Workaround:** Retry or use different model

---

### ❌ ISSUE #7: Multiple Function Call Limitations (UPSTREAM - NOT FIXABLE BY US)

**Problem:** xAI cannot invoke multiple functions in one response
**Impact:** Sequential tool execution only, no parallel tools
**Evidence:** Medium article: "XAI cannot invoke multiple function calls"
**Status:** ❌ UPSTREAM ISSUE - Model limitation
**Workaround:** Design workflows for sequential tool use

## 🎯 Recommended Actions

### For Users

**DON'T USE GROK** for:
- Tool-heavy workflows (Read, Write, Edit, Grep, etc.)
- Production use
- Critical tasks requiring reliability

**USE GROK ONLY FOR**:
- Simple text generation (no tools)
- Experimentation
- Cost-sensitive non-critical tasks

**RECOMMENDED ALTERNATIVES:**
1. `openai/gpt-5-codex` - Best for coding (our new top recommendation)
2. `minimax/minimax-m2` - High performance, good compatibility
3. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5` - Gold standard (expensive but reliable)
4. `qwen/qwen3-vl-235b-a22b-instruct` - Vision + coding

### For Claudish Maintainers

**Short Term (Done):**
- ✅ Fix visible reasoning
- ✅ Fix encrypted reasoning
- ✅ Add XML format workaround
- ✅ Document all issues
- ⏳ Update README with warnings

**Medium Term (This Week):**
- [ ] Move Grok to bottom of recommended models list
- [ ] Add prominent warning in README
- [ ] File bug reports with OpenRouter
- [ ] File bug reports with xAI
- [ ] Monitor for upstream fixes

**Long Term (If No Upstream Fix):**
- [ ] Implement XML parser as full fallback (complex)
- [ ] Add comprehensive xAI compatibility layer
- [ ] Consider removing Grok from recommendations entirely

## 📈 Impact Assessment

**Before Our Fixes:**
- Grok 0% usable (all tools broken + UI freezing)

**After Our Fixes:**
- Grok ~30% usable (reasoning works, but tools still broken due to upstream issues)

**If Upstream Fixes Their Issues:**
- Grok could be 90%+ usable (only model limitations remain)

**Realistically:**
- Grok will likely remain problematic until OpenRouter/xAI prioritize fixes
- Timeline for upstream fixes: Unknown (could be weeks/months)
