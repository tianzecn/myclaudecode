# Changelog

## [1.0.9] - 2024-11-10

### Added
- ✅ **Headless Mode (Print Mode)** - Automatic `-p` flag in single-shot mode
  - Ensures claudish exits immediately after task completion
  - No UI hanging, perfect for automation
  - Works seamlessly in background scripts and CI/CD

- ✅ **Quiet Mode (Default in Single-Shot)** - Clean output without log pollution
  - Single-shot mode: quiet by default (no `[claudish]` logs)
  - Interactive mode: verbose by default (shows all logs)
  - Override with `--quiet` or `--verbose` flags
  - Perfect for piping output to other tools
  - Redirect to files without log contamination

- ✅ **JSON Output Mode** - Structured data for tool integration
  - New `--json` flag enables Claude Code's JSON output
  - Always runs in quiet mode (no log pollution)

  - Perfect for automation, scripting, and cost tracking
  - Easy parsing with `jq` or other JSON tools

### Changed
- Build size: ~46 KB (minified)
- Enhanced CLI with new flags: `--quiet`, `--verbose`, `--json`
- Updated help documentation with output mode examples

### Examples
```bash
# Quiet mode (default) - clean output
claudish "what is 3+4?"

# Verbose mode - show logs
claudish --verbose "analyze code"

# JSON output - structured data
claudish --json "list 3 colors" | jq '.result'

# Track costs
claudish --json "task" | jq '{result, cost: .total_cost_usd}'
```

### Use Cases
- CI/CD pipelines
- Automated scripts
- Tool integration
- Cost tracking
- Clean output for pipes
- Background processing

## [1.0.8] - 2024-11-10

### Fixed
- ✅ **CRITICAL**: Fixed model identity role-playing issue
  - Non-Claude models (Grok, GPT, etc.) now correctly identify themselves
  - Added comprehensive system prompt filtering to remove Claude identity claims
  - Filters Claude-specific prompts: "You are Claude", "powered by Sonnet/Haiku/Opus", etc.
  - Added explicit identity override instruction to prevent role-playing
  - Removes `<claude_background_info>` tags that contain misleading model information
  - **Before**: Grok responded "I am Claude, created by Anthropic"
  - **After**: Grok responds "I am Grok, an AI model built by xAI"

### Technical Details
- System prompt filtering in `src/api-translator.ts`:
  - Replaces "You are Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI" → "This is Claude Code, an AI-powered CLI tool"
  - Replaces "You are powered by the model named X" → "You are powered by an AI model"
  - Removes `<claude_background_info>` XML tags
  - Adds explicit instruction: "You are NOT Claude. You are NOT created by Anthropic."
- Build size: 19.43 KB

### Changed
- Enhanced API translation to preserve model identity while maintaining Claude Code functionality
- Models now truthfully identify themselves while still having access to all Claude Code tools

## [1.0.7] - 2024-11-10

### Fixed
- ✅ Clean console output in debug mode
  - Proxy logs now go to file only (not console)
  - Console only shows essential claudish messages
  - No more console flooding with [Proxy] logs
  - Perfect for clean interactive sessions

### Changed
- `dev:grok` script now includes `--debug` by default
- Build size: 17.68 KB

### Usage
```bash
# Clean console with all logs in file
bun run dev:grok

# Or manually
claudish -i -d --model x-ai/grok-code-fast-1
```

## [1.0.6] - 2024-11-10

### Added
- ✅ **Debug logging to file** with `--debug` or `-d` flag
  - Creates timestamped log files in `logs/` directory
  - One log file per session: `claudish_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.log`
  - Logs all proxy activity: requests, responses, translations
  - Keeps console clean - only essential messages shown
  - Full request/response JSON logged for analysis
  - Perfect for debugging model routing issues

### Changed
- Build size: 17.68 KB
- Improved debugging capabilities
- Added `logs/` to `.gitignore`

### Usage
```bash
# Enable debug logging
claudish --debug --model x-ai/grok-code-fast-1 "your prompt"

# Or in interactive mode
claudish -i -d --model x-ai/grok-code-fast-1

# View log after completion
cat logs/claudish_*.log
```

## [1.0.5] - 2024-11-10

### Fixed
- ✅ Fixed proxy timeout error: "request timed out after 10 seconds"
  - Added `idleTimeout: 255` (4.25 minutes, Bun maximum) to server configuration
  - Prevents timeout during long streaming responses
  - Ensures proxy can handle Claude Code requests without timing out
- ✅ Implemented `/v1/messages/count_tokens` endpoint
  - Claude Code uses this to estimate token usage
  - No more 404 errors for token counting
  - Uses rough estimation (~4 chars per token)
- ✅ Added comprehensive proxy logging
  - Log all incoming requests (method + pathname)
  - Log routing to OpenRouter model
  - Log streaming vs non-streaming request types
  - Better debugging for connection issues

### Changed
- Build size: 16.73 KB
- Improved proxy reliability and completeness

## [1.0.4] - 2024-11-10

### Fixed
- ✅ **REQUIRED**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is now mandatory to prevent Claude Code dialog
  - Claudish now refuses to start if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is not set
  - Clear error message with setup instructions
  - Prevents users from accidentally using real Anthropic API instead of proxy
  - Ensures status line and model routing work correctly

### Changed
- Build size: 15.56 KB
- Stricter environment validation for better UX

## [1.0.3] - 2024-11-10

### Changed
- ✅ Improved API key handling for Claude Code prompt
  - Use existing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from environment if set
  - Display clear warning and instructions if not set
  - Updated `.env.example` with recommended placeholder
  - Updated README with setup instructions
  - Note: If prompt appears, select "Yes" - key is not used (proxy handles auth)

### Documentation
- Added `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to environment variables table
- Added setup step in Quick Start guide
- Clarified that placeholder key is for prompt bypass only

### Changed
- Build size: 15.80 KB

## [1.0.2] - 2024-11-10

### Fixed
- ✅ Eliminated streaming errors (Controller is already closed)
  - Added safe enqueue/close wrapper functions
  - Track controller state to prevent double-close
  - Avoid duplicate message_stop events
- ✅ Fixed OpenRouter API error with max_tokens
  - Ensure minimum max_tokens value of 16 (OpenAI requirement)
  - Added automatic adjustment in API translator

### Changed
- Build size: 15.1 KB
- Improved streaming robustness
- Better provider compatibility

## [1.0.1] - 2024-11-10

### Fixed
- ✅ Use correct Claude Code flag: `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (not `--auto-approve`)
- ✅ Permissions are skipped by default for autonomous operation
- ✅ Use `--no-auto-approve` to enable permission prompts
- ✅ Use valid-looking Anthropic API key format to avoid Claude Code prompts
  - Claude Code no longer prompts about "custom API key"
  - Proxy still handles actual auth with OpenRouter

### Changed
- Updated help text to reflect correct flag usage
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY now uses `sk-ant-api03-...` format (placeholder, proxy handles auth)
- Build size: 14.86 KB

## [1.0.0] - 2024-11-10

### Added
- ✅ Local Anthropic API proxy for OpenRouter models
- ✅ Interactive mode (`--interactive` or `-i`) for persistent sessions
- ✅ Status line model display (shows "via Provider/Model" in Claude status bar)
- ✅ Interactive model selector with Ink UI (arrow keys, provider badges)
- ✅ Custom model entry support
- ✅ 5 verified models (100% tested NOT Anthropic):
  - `x-ai/grok-code-fast-1` - xAI's Grok
  - `openai/gpt-5-codex` - OpenAI's GPT-5 Codex
  - `minimax/minimax-m2` - MiniMax M2
  - `z-ai/glm-4.6` - Zhipu AI's GLM
  - `qwen/qwen3-vl-235b-a22b-instruct` - Alibaba's Qwen
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (11/11 passing)
- ✅ API format translation (Anthropic ↔ OpenRouter)
- ✅ Streaming support (SSE)
- ✅ Random port allocation for parallel runs
- ✅ Environment variable support (OPENROUTER_API_KEY, CLAUDISH_MODEL, CLAUDISH_PORT)
- ✅ Dangerous mode (`--dangerous` - disables sandbox)

### Technical Details
- TypeScript + Bun runtime
- Ink for terminal UI
- Biome for linting/formatting
- Build size: 14.20 KB (minified)
- Test duration: 56.94 seconds (11 tests)

### Verified Working
- All 5 user-specified models tested and proven to route correctly
- Zero false positives (no non-Anthropic model identified as Anthropic)
- Control test with actual Anthropic model confirms methodology
- Improved test question with examples yields consistent responses

### Known Limitations
- `--auto-approve` flag doesn't exist in Claude Code CLI (removed from v1.0.0)
- Some models proxied through other providers (e.g., MiniMax via OpenAI)
- Integration tests have 2 failures due to old model IDs (cosmetic issue)

### Documentation
- Complete user guide (README.md)
- Development guide (DEVELOPMENT.md)
- Evidence documentation (ai_docs/wip/)
- Integration with main repo (CLAUDE.md, main README.md)

**Status:** Production Ready ✅
