# Agent Instructions

[System prompt and instructions here]
```

---

## Key Patterns

### Proxy Mode
Allows agents to delegate to external AI models:
```
PROXY_MODE: x-ai/grok-code-fast-1
[actual task here]
```

### TodoWrite Integration
Agents should track progress:
```markdown
1. Create todo list at start
2. Mark tasks in_progress when starting
3. Mark completed immediately when done
```

### Quality Checks
- YAML frontmatter validation
- XML structure compliance
- Description with examples
- Tool permissions

---

## LLM Performance Tracking (v1.1.0)

Tracks external model performance to `ai-docs/llm-performance.json`:
- Plan review execution times
- Quality review scores
- Model reliability metrics

---

## Dependencies

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "orchestration@tianzecn-plugins": "^0.2.0"

}
```
