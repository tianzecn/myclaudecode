There are a few approaches we could take:\n\n1. **In-memory cache with Map** - Simple, fast, but lost on restart\n2. **Redis cache** - Persistent, supports TTL, but requires Redis dependency\n3. **LocalStorage cache** - Browser-based persistence, good for client-side\n\nWhich approach would you prefer for this use case?"
