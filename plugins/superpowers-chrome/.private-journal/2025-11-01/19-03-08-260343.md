## Project Notes

Successfully implemented session-based auto-capture for superpowers-chrome:

✅ Complete features:
- Session directory: `/tmp/chrome-session-{timestamp}/`
- Time-ordered captures: `001-action-{timestamp}/`
- Auto-capture for: navigate, click, type, select, eval
- Files per capture: page.html, page.md, page.png
- Enhanced MCP responses with full context
- Automatic cleanup on exit (SIGINT/SIGTERM)
- Console log placeholder (infrastructure ready)

✅ Response format:
- Action description
- Page size information  
- Session and capture directory paths
- File locations
- Console log (placeholder)
- DOM structure summary

This gives Claude incredible context about browser state after every DOM-changing action, while maintaining organized capture history for debugging. The session-based approach is much cleaner than the previous single temp directory per action.

Perfect implementation of Jesse's requirements!
