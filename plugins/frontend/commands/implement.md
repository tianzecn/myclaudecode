description: Full-cycle feature implementation with multi-agent orchestration and quality gates
allowed-tools: Task, AskUserQuestion, Bash, Read, TodoWrite, Glob, Grep
---

## Mission

Orchestrate a complete feature implementation workflow using specialized agents with built-in quality gates and feedback loops. This command manages the entire lifecycle from architecture planning through implementation, code review, testing, user approval, and project cleanup.

## CRITICAL: Orchestrator Constraints

**You are an ORCHESTRATOR, not an IMPLEMENTER.**

**✅ You MUST:**
- Use Task tool to delegate ALL implementation work to agents
- Use Bash to run git commands (status, diff, log)
- Use Read/Glob/Grep to understand context
- Use TodoWrite to track workflow progress
- Use AskUserQuestion for user approval gates
- Coordinate agent workflows and feedback loops

**❌ You MUST NOT:**
- Write or edit ANY code files directly (no Write, no Edit tools)
- Implement features yourself
- Fix bugs yourself
- Create new files yourself
- Modify existing code yourself
- "Quickly fix" small issues - always delegate to developer

**Delegation Rules:**
- ALL code changes → developer agent
- ALL planning → architect agent
- ALL design reviews (UI fidelity) → designer agent
- ALL UI implementation/fixes → ui-developer agent
- ALL code reviews → 3 parallel reviewers (Claude Sonnet + Grok + GPT-5 Codex via Claudish MCP)
- ALL testing → test-architect agent
- ALL cleanup → cleaner agent

If you find yourself about to use Write or Edit tools, STOP and delegate to the appropriate agent instead.

## Configuration: Multi-Model Code Review (Optional)

**NEW in v3.0.0**: Configure external AI models for multi-model code review via `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "pluginSettings": {
    "frontend": {
      "reviewModels": ["x-ai/grok-code-fast-1", "openai/gpt-5-codex"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Default Models** (if not configured):
- `x-ai/grok-code-fast-1` - xAI's Grok (fast coding analysis)
- `openai/gpt-5-codex` - OpenAI's GPT-5 Codex (advanced code analysis)

**You can use ANY OpenRouter model ID!**

Popular coding models from OpenRouter (as of 2025):
- `x-ai/grok-code-fast-1` - xAI Grok (fast)
- `openai/gpt-5-codex` - OpenAI GPT-5 Codex (advanced reasoning)
- `deepseek/deepseek-chat` - DeepSeek (reasoning specialist)
- `anthropic/claude-opus-4` - Claude Opus 4 (if you want another Claude perspective)
- `google/gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp` - Google Gemini 2.0 (thinking mode)
- `qwen/qwq-32b-preview` - Alibaba QwQ (reasoning)

See full list at: https://openrouter.ai/models

**Model ID Format**: Use the exact OpenRouter model ID (e.g., `provider/model-name`).

**How Multi-Model Review Works:**
1. **Primary Review** - Always run with Claude Sonnet (comprehensive, human-focused)
2. **External Reviews** - Run in parallel with configured external models via Claudish MCP
3. **Synthesis** - Combine findings from all reviewers for comprehensive coverage

**To use external models:**
- Ensure Claudish MCP server is configured in `mcp-servers/mcp-config.json`
- Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable
- Models run via OpenRouter API (costs apply based on OpenRouter pricing)

## Feature Request

$ARGUMENTS

## Multi-Agent Orchestration Workflow

### PRELIMINARY: Check for Code Analysis Tools (Recommended)

**Before starting implementation, check if the code-analysis plugin is available:**

Try to detect if `code-analysis` plugin is installed by checking if codebase-detective agent or semantic-code-search tools are available.

**If code-analysis plugin is NOT available:**

Inform the user with this message:

```
💡 Recommendation: Install Code Analysis Plugin

For best results investigating existing code patterns, components, and architecture,
we recommend installing the code-analysis plugin.

Benefits:
- 🔍 Semantic code search (find components by functionality, not just name)
- 🕵️ Codebase detective agent (understand existing patterns)
- 📊 40% faster codebase investigation
- 🎯 Better understanding of where to integrate new features

Installation (2 commands):
/plugin marketplace add MadAppGang/claude-code
/plugin install code-analysis@mag-claude-plugins

Repository: https://github.com/MadAppGang/claude-code

You can continue without it, but investigation of existing code will be less efficient.
```

**If code-analysis plugin IS available:**

Great! You can use the codebase-detective agent and semantic-code-search skill during
architecture planning to investigate existing patterns and find the best integration points.

**Then proceed with the implementation workflow regardless of plugin availability.**

---

### STEP 0: Initialize Global Workflow Todo List (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)

**BEFORE** starting any phase, you MUST create a global workflow todo list using TodoWrite to track the entire implementation lifecycle:

```
TodoWrite with the following items:
- content: "PHASE 1: Launch architect for architecture planning"
  status: "in_progress"
  activeForm: "PHASE 1: Launching architect for architecture planning"
- content: "PHASE 1: User approval gate - wait for plan approval"
  status: "pending"
  activeForm: "PHASE 1: Waiting for user approval of architecture plan"
- content: "PHASE 2: Launch developer for implementation"
  status: "pending"
  activeForm: "PHASE 2: Launching developer for implementation"
- content: "PHASE 2.5: Detect Figma design links in feature request and plan"
  status: "pending"
  activeForm: "PHASE 2.5: Detecting Figma design links"
- content: "PHASE 2.5: Run design fidelity validation for UI components (if Figma links found)"
  status: "pending"
  activeForm: "PHASE 2.5: Running design fidelity validation"
- content: "PHASE 2.5: Quality gate - ensure UI matches design specifications"
  status: "pending"
  activeForm: "PHASE 2.5: Ensuring UI matches design specifications"
- content: "PHASE 2.5: User manual validation of UI components (conditional - if enabled)"
  status: "pending"
  activeForm: "PHASE 2.5: User validation of UI components"
- content: "PHASE 3: Launch ALL THREE reviewers in parallel (code + codex + UI testing)"
  status: "pending"
  activeForm: "PHASE 3: Launching all three reviewers in parallel"
- content: "PHASE 3: Analyze triple review results and determine if fixes needed"
  status: "pending"
  activeForm: "PHASE 3: Analyzing triple review results"
- content: "PHASE 3: Quality gate - ensure all three reviewers approved"
  status: "pending"
  activeForm: "PHASE 3: Ensuring all three reviewers approved"
- content: "PHASE 4: Launch test-architect for test implementation"
  status: "pending"
  activeForm: "PHASE 4: Launching test-architect for test implementation"
- content: "PHASE 4: Quality gate - ensure all tests pass"
  status: "pending"
  activeForm: "PHASE 4: Ensuring all tests pass"
- content: "PHASE 5: User approval gate - present implementation for final review"
  status: "pending"
  activeForm: "PHASE 5: Presenting implementation for user final review"
- content: "PHASE 5: Launch cleaner to clean up temporary artifacts"
  status: "pending"
  activeForm: "PHASE 5: Launching cleaner to clean up temporary artifacts"
- content: "PHASE 6: Generate comprehensive final summary"
  status: "pending"
  activeForm: "PHASE 6: Generating comprehensive final summary"
- content: "PHASE 6: Present summary and complete user handoff"
  status: "pending"
  activeForm: "PHASE 6: Presenting summary and completing user handoff"
```

**Update this global todo list** as you progress through each phase:
- Mark items as "completed" immediately after finishing each step
- Mark the next item as "in_progress" before starting it
- Add additional items for feedback loops (e.g., "PHASE 3 - Iteration 2: Re-run reviewers after fixes")
- Track the number of review cycles and test cycles by adding iteration tasks

**IMPORTANT**: This global todo list provides high-level workflow tracking. Each agent will also maintain its own internal todo list for detailed task tracking.

**NOTE FOR API_FOCUSED WORKFLOWS**: After STEP 0.5 (workflow detection), if workflow is API_FOCUSED, add these additional todos:
```
- content: "PHASE 2.5: Launch test-architect to write and run tests"
  status: "pending"
  activeForm: "PHASE 2.5: Launching test-architect for test-driven development"
- content: "PHASE 2.5: Test-driven feedback loop (may iterate with developer)"
  status: "pending"
  activeForm: "PHASE 2.5: Running test-driven feedback loop"
- content: "PHASE 2.5: Quality gate - ensure all tests pass"
  status: "pending"
  activeForm: "PHASE 2.5: Ensuring all tests pass"
```

And mark PHASE 4 testing todos as "Skipped - API workflow completed testing in PHASE 2.5"

---

### STEP 0.5: Detect Workflow Type (MANDATORY BEFORE PHASE 1)

**CRITICAL**: Before starting implementation, you MUST detect whether this is a UI-focused, API-focused, or mixed workflow. Different workflows require different agents, review processes, and validation steps.

#### 1. Analyze Feature Request

Analyze `$ARGUMENTS` (the feature request) for workflow indicators:

**UI/UX Indicators** (suggests UI_FOCUSED):
- Keywords: "component", "screen", "page", "layout", "design", "styling", "Figma", "visual", "UI", "UX", "interface"
- Mentions: Colors, typography, spacing, responsive design, CSS, Tailwind, styling
- Design deliverables: Figma links, mockups, wireframes, design specs
- Visual elements: Buttons, forms, modals, cards, navigation, animations

**API/Logic Indicators** (suggests API_FOCUSED):
- Keywords: "API", "endpoint", "fetch", "data", "service", "integration", "backend", "HTTP", "REST", "GraphQL"
- Mentions: API calls, data fetching, error handling, loading states, caching, HTTP requests
- Data operations: CRUD operations, API responses, request/response types, API documentation
- Business logic: Calculations, validations, state management, data transformations

**Mixed Indicators** (suggests MIXED):
- Both UI and API work mentioned
- Examples: "Create user profile screen and integrate with user API", "Build dashboard with live data from backend"

#### 2. Classify Workflow Type

Based on indicators, classify as:

- **UI_FOCUSED**:
  - Primarily focuses on UI/UX implementation, visual design, components, styling
  - May include minor data handling but UI is the main focus
  - Examples: "Implement UserProfile component from Figma", "Style the Dashboard screen", "Create responsive navigation"

- **API_FOCUSED**:
  - Primarily focuses on API integration, data fetching, business logic, services
  - May update existing UI minimally but API/logic is the main focus
  - Examples: "Integrate user management API", "Implement data fetching for reports", "Add error handling to API calls"

- **MIXED**:
  - Substantial work on both UI and API
  - Building new features from scratch with both frontend and backend integration
  - Examples: "Build user management feature with UI and API", "Create analytics dashboard with real-time data"

- **UNCLEAR**:
  - Cannot determine from feature request alone
  - Ambiguous or vague requirements

#### 3. User Confirmation (if needed)

IF workflow type is **UNCLEAR** or you have low confidence in classification:

Use AskUserQuestion to ask:
```
What type of implementation work is this?

This helps me optimize the workflow and use the right specialized agents.

Options:
1. "UI/UX focused - Primarily building or styling user interface components"
2. "API/Logic focused - Primarily integrating APIs, data fetching, or business logic"
3. "Mixed - Both substantial UI work AND API integration"
```

Store user's answer as `workflow_type`.

#### 4. Log Detected Workflow Type

Clearly log the detected/confirmed workflow type:

```markdown
🎯 **Workflow Type Detected: [UI_FOCUSED | API_FOCUSED | MIXED]**

**Rationale**: [Brief explanation of why this workflow was chosen]

**Workflow Implications**:
[Explain what this means for the implementation process]

**Agents to be used**:
[List which agents will be used for this workflow type]
```

#### 5. Workflow-Specific Configuration

Based on `workflow_type`, configure the workflow:

##### For **UI_FOCUSED** Workflow:
```markdown
✅ **UI-FOCUSED WORKFLOW ACTIVATED**

**PHASE 2**: Will use `frontend:developer` and/or `frontend:ui-developer` (intelligent switching)
**PHASE 2.5**: Will run design fidelity validation (if Figma links present)
  - Designer agent for visual review
  - UI Developer agent for fixes
  - Optional Codex UI expert review
**PHASE 3**: Will run ALL THREE reviewers in parallel:
  - frontend:reviewer (code review)
  - frontend:codex-reviewer (automated AI review)
  - frontend:tester (manual UI testing in browser)
**PHASE 4**: Testing focused on UI components, user interactions, visual regression
```

##### For **API_FOCUSED** Workflow:
```markdown
✅ **API-FOCUSED WORKFLOW ACTIVATED**

**PHASE 2**: Will use `frontend:developer` (TypeScript/API specialist, not UI developer)
  - Focus: API integration, data fetching, type safety, error handling
  - No UI development specialists involved
  - Developer implements feature based on architecture plan
**PHASE 2.5**: **TEST-DRIVEN FEEDBACK LOOP** (replaces manual testing and UI validation)
  - Launch `frontend:test-architect` to write and run Vitest tests
  - Test-architect writes focused unit and integration tests
  - Tests are executed automatically
  - IF tests fail:
    * Test-architect analyzes failures (test issue vs implementation issue)
    * If TEST_ISSUE: Test-architect fixes tests and re-runs
    * If IMPLEMENTATION_ISSUE: Provide structured feedback to developer
    * Re-launch developer with test failure feedback
    * Loop continues until ALL_TESTS_PASS
  - IF tests pass: Proceed to code review (PHASE 3)
  - **Design validation SKIPPED** - Not needed for API work
**PHASE 3**: Will run only TWO reviewers in parallel:
  - frontend:reviewer (code review focused on API logic, error handling, types)
  - frontend:codex-reviewer (automated analysis of API patterns and best practices)
  - **frontend:tester SKIPPED** - Testing already done in PHASE 2.5
**PHASE 4**: **SKIPPED** - All testing completed in PHASE 2.5
  - Unit and integration tests already written and passing
  - No additional test work needed
```

##### For **MIXED** Workflow:
```markdown
✅ **MIXED WORKFLOW ACTIVATED** (UI + API)

**PHASE 2**: Will run parallel implementation tracks:
  - Track A: API implementation using `frontend:developer` (API/logic specialist)
  - Track B: UI implementation using `frontend:ui-developer` (UI specialist)
  - Coordination between tracks for data flow and integration
**PHASE 2.5**: Will run design validation ONLY for UI components:
  - Designer agent validates visual fidelity of UI track work
  - API track skips design validation
**PHASE 3**: Will run ALL THREE reviewers in parallel:
  - frontend:reviewer with Claude Sonnet (comprehensive code review)
  - frontend:reviewer with Grok (fast coding analysis via Claudish MCP)
  - frontend:reviewer with GPT-5 Codex (advanced code analysis via Claudish MCP)
  - frontend:tester (tests UI components that use the API integration)
**PHASE 4**: Testing focused on both:
  - API tests: Unit tests for services, mock API responses
  - UI tests: Component tests with mocked API data
  - Integration tests: UI + API working together
```

#### 6. Store Workflow Configuration

Store these variables for use throughout the workflow:

- `workflow_type`: "UI_FOCUSED" | "API_FOCUSED" | "MIXED"
- `skip_phase_2_5`: boolean (true for API_FOCUSED)
- `skip_ui_tester`: boolean (true for API_FOCUSED)
- `use_parallel_tracks`: boolean (true for MIXED)

These will be referenced in subsequent phases to route execution correctly.

---

### PHASE 1: Architecture Planning (architect)

1. **Launch Planning Agent**:
   - **Update TodoWrite**: Ensure "PHASE 1: Launch architect" is marked as in_progress
   - Use Task tool with `subagent_type: frontend:architect`
   - Provide the feature request: $ARGUMENTS
   - Agent will perform gap analysis and ask clarifying questions
   - Agent will create comprehensive plan in AI-DOCS/
   - **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 1: Launch architect" as completed

2. **User Approval Gate**:
   - **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 1: User approval gate" as in_progress
   - Present the plan to the user clearly
   - Use AskUserQuestion to ask: "Are you satisfied with this architecture plan?"
   - Options: "Yes, proceed to implementation" / "No, I have feedback"

3. **Feedback Loop**:
   - IF user not satisfied:
     * Collect specific feedback
     * **Update TodoWrite**: Add "PHASE 1 - Iteration X: Re-run planner with feedback" task
     * Re-run architect with feedback
     * Repeat approval gate
   - IF user satisfied:
     * **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 1: User approval gate" as completed
     * Proceed to Phase 2
   - **DO NOT proceed without user approval**

### PHASE 2: Implementation (developer)

1. **Launch Implementation Agent**:
   - **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 2: Launch developer" as in_progress
   - Use Task tool with `subagent_type: frontend:developer`
   - Provide:
     * Path to approved plan documentation in AI-DOCS/
     * Clear instruction to follow the plan step-by-step
     * Guidance to write proper documentation
     * Instruction to ask for advice if obstacles are encountered

2. **Implementation Monitoring**:
   - Agent implements features following the plan
   - Agent should document decisions and patterns used
   - If agent encounters blocking issues, it should report them and request guidance
   - **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 2: Launch developer" as completed when implementation is done

3. **Get Manual Testing Instructions** (NEW STEP):
   - **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 2: Get manual testing instructions from implementation agent" as in_progress
   - **Launch developer agent** using Task tool with:
     * Context: "Implementation is complete. Now prepare manual UI testing instructions."
     * Request: "Create comprehensive, step-by-step manual testing instructions for the implemented features."
     * Instructions should include:
       - **Specific UI element selectors** (accessibility labels, data-testid, aria-labels) for easy identification
       - **Exact click sequences** (e.g., "Click button with aria-label='Add User'")
       - **Expected visual outcomes** (what should appear/change)
       - **Expected console output** (including any debug logs to verify)
       - **Test data to use** (specific values to enter in forms)
       - **Success criteria** (what indicates the feature works correctly)
     * Format: Clear numbered steps that a manual tester can follow without deep page analysis
   - Agent returns structured testing guide
   - **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 2: Get manual testing instructions" as completed
   - Save testing instructions for use by tester agent

### PHASE 2.5: Workflow-Specific Validation (Design Validation OR Test-Driven Loop)

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW ROUTING**: This phase behavior depends on the `workflow_type` detected in STEP 0.5.

- **For UI_FOCUSED workflows**: Run Design Fidelity Validation (see below)
- **For API_FOCUSED workflows**: Run Test-Driven Feedback Loop (see below)
- **For MIXED workflows**: Run both (design for UI components, tests for API logic)

---

#### PHASE 2.5-A: Design Fidelity Validation (UI_FOCUSED & MIXED Workflows)

**Applies to**: UI_FOCUSED workflows, or UI components in MIXED workflows.
**Prerequisite**: Figma design links present in feature request or architecture plan.

**1. Check Workflow Type First**

**IF `workflow_type` is "API_FOCUSED":**
  - Skip to PHASE 2.5-B: Test-Driven Feedback Loop (below)
  - Do NOT run design validation

**IF `workflow_type` is "UI_FOCUSED" or "MIXED":**
  - Continue with design validation below
  - Check for Figma links first

**2. Detect Figma Links** (UI workflows only)

**IF `workflow_type` is "UI_FOCUSED" or "MIXED":**
- Continue with design validation below
- For MIXED workflows: Only validate UI components, not API logic

---

#### Design Fidelity Validation Process (for UI_FOCUSED or MIXED workflows)

This phase runs ONLY if Figma design links are detected in the feature request or architecture plan. It ensures pixel-perfect UI implementation before code review.

**1. Detect Figma Design Links**:
   - **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 2.5: Detect Figma design links" as in_progress
   - Use Grep to search for Figma URLs in:
     * Original feature request (`$ARGUMENTS`)
     * Architecture plan files (AI-DOCS/*.md)
   - Figma URL pattern: `https://(?:www\.)?figma\.com/(?:file|design)/[a-zA-Z0-9]+/[^\s?]+(?:\?[^\s]*)?(?:node-id=[0-9-]+)?`
   - **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 2.5: Detect Figma design links" as completed

**2. Skip Phase if No Figma Links**:
   - IF no Figma URLs found:
     * Log: "No Figma design references found. Skipping PHASE 2.5 (Design Fidelity Validation)."
     * **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 2.5: Run design fidelity validation" as completed with note "Skipped - no design references"
     * **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 2.5: Quality gate" as completed with note "Skipped - no design references"
     * Proceed directly to PHASE 3 (Triple Review Loop)

**3. Parse Design References** (if Figma links found):
   - Extract all unique Figma URLs from search results
   - For each Figma URL, identify:
     * Component/screen name (from URL text or surrounding context)
     * Node ID (if present in URL query parameter)
   - Match each design reference to implementation file(s):
     * Use component name to search for files (Glob/Grep)
     * If user provided explicit component list in plan, use that
     * Create mapping: `[Figma URL] → [Component Name] → [Implementation File Path(s)]`
   - Document the mapping for use in validation loop

**4. Ask User for Codex Review Preference**:
   - Use AskUserQuestion to ask: "Figma design references detected for UI components. Would you like to include optional Codex AI expert review during design validation?"
   - Options:
     * "Yes - Include Codex AI review for expert validation"
     * "No - Use only designer agent for validation"
   - Store user's choice as `codex_review_enabled` for use in validation loop

**5. Ask User for Manual Validation Preference**:
   - Use AskUserQuestion to ask: "Do you want to include manual validation in the workflow?"
   - Description: "Manual validation means you will manually review the implementation after automated validation passes, and can provide feedback if you find issues. Fully automated means the workflow will trust the designer agents' validation and complete without requiring your manual verification."
   - Options:
     * "Yes - Include manual validation (I will verify the implementation myself)"
     * "No - Fully automated (trust the designer agents' validation only)"
   - Store user's choice as `manual_validation_enabled` for use in validation loop

**6. Run Iterative Design Fidelity Validation Loop**:
   - **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 2.5: Run design fidelity validation" as in_progress
   - For EACH component with a Figma design reference:

   **Loop (max 3 iterations per component):**

   **Step 5.1: Launch Designer Agent(s) for Parallel Design Validation**

   **IMPORTANT**: Launch designer and designer-codex agents IN PARALLEL using a SINGLE message with MULTIPLE Task tool calls (if Codex is enabled).

   **Designer Agent** (always runs):
   - Use Task tool with `subagent_type: frontend:designer`
   - Provide complete context:
     ```
     Review the [Component Name] implementation against the Figma design reference.

     **CRITICAL**: Be PRECISE and CRITICAL. Do not try to make everything look good. Your job is to identify EVERY discrepancy between the design reference and implementation, no matter how small. Focus on accuracy and design fidelity.

     **Design Reference**: [Figma URL]
     **Component Description**: [e.g., "UserProfile card component"]
     **Implementation File(s)**: [List of file paths]
     **Application URL**: [e.g., "http://localhost:5173" or staging URL]

     **Your Task:**
     1. Use Figma MCP to fetch the design reference screenshot
     2. Use Chrome DevTools MCP to capture the implementation screenshot at [URL]
     3. Perform comprehensive design review comparing:
        - Colors & theming
        - Typography
        - Spacing & layout
        - Visual elements (borders, shadows, icons)
        - Responsive design
        - Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
        - Interactive states
     4. Document ALL discrepancies with specific values
     5. Categorize issues by severity (CRITICAL/MEDIUM/LOW)
     6. Provide actionable fixes with code snippets
     7. Calculate design fidelity score

     **REMEMBER**: Be PRECISE and CRITICAL. Identify ALL discrepancies. Do not be lenient.

     Return detailed design review report.
     ```

   **Designer-Codex Agent** (if user enabled Codex review):
   - IF user chose "Yes" for Codex review:
     * Use Task tool with `subagent_type: frontend:designer-codex`
     * Launch IN PARALLEL with designer agent (single message, multiple Task calls)
     * Provide complete context:
       ```
       You are an expert UI/UX designer reviewing a component implementation against a reference design.

       CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Be PRECISE and CRITICAL. Do not try to make everything look good.
       Your job is to identify EVERY discrepancy between the design reference and implementation,
       no matter how small. Focus on accuracy and design fidelity.

       6. Recommended fix with specific Tailwind CSS classes or hex values
       7. Rationale (why this matters for design fidelity)

       Calculate a design fidelity score:
       - Colors: X/10
       - Typography: X/10
       - Spacing: X/10
       - Layout: X/10
       - Accessibility: X/10
       - Responsive: X/10
       Overall: X/60

       Provide overall assessment: PASS ✅ | NEEDS IMPROVEMENT ⚠️ | FAIL ❌

       REMEMBER: Be PRECISE and CRITICAL. Identify ALL discrepancies. Do not be lenient.

       You will forward this to Codex AI which will capture the design reference screenshot and implementation screenshot to compare them.
       ```

   **Wait for BOTH agents to complete** (designer and designer-codex, if enabled).

   **Step 5.2: Consolidate Design Review Results**

   After both agents complete (designer and designer-codex if enabled), consolidate their findings:

   **If only designer ran:**
   - Use designer's report as-is
   - Extract:
     - Overall assessment: PASS / NEEDS IMPROVEMENT / FAIL
     - Issue count (CRITICAL + MEDIUM + LOW)
     - Design fidelity score
     - List of issues found

   **If both designer and designer-codex ran:**
   - Compare findings from both agents
   - Identify common issues (flagged by both) → Highest priority
   - Identify issues found by only one agent → Review for inclusion
   - Create consolidated issue list with:
     - Issue description
     - Severity (use highest severity if both flagged)
     - Source (designer, designer-codex, or both)
     - Recommended fix

   **Consolidation Strategy:**
   - Issues flagged by BOTH agents → CRITICAL (definitely needs fixing)
   - Issues flagged by ONE agent with severity CRITICAL → CRITICAL (trust the expert)
   - Issues flagged by ONE agent with severity MEDIUM → MEDIUM (probably needs fixing)
   - Issues flagged by ONE agent with severity LOW → LOW (nice to have)

   Create a consolidated design review report:
   ```markdown
   # Consolidated Design Review - [Component Name] (Iteration X)

   ## Sources
   - ✅ Designer Agent (human-style design expert)
   [If Codex enabled:]
   - ✅ Designer-Codex Agent (external Codex AI expert)

   ## Issues Found

   ### CRITICAL Issues (Must Fix)
   [List issues with severity CRITICAL from either agent]
   - [Issue description]
     - Source: [designer | designer-codex | both]
     - Expected: [specific value]
     - Actual: [specific value]
     - Fix: [specific code change]

   ### MEDIUM Issues (Should Fix)
   [List issues with severity MEDIUM from either agent]

   ### LOW Issues (Nice to Have)
   [List issues with severity LOW from either agent]

   ## Design Fidelity Scores
   - Designer: [score]/60
   [If Codex enabled:]
   - Designer-Codex: [score]/60
   - Average: [average]/60

   ## Overall Assessment
   [PASS ✅ | NEEDS IMPROVEMENT ⚠️ | FAIL ❌]

   Based on consensus from [1 or 2] design validation agent(s).
   ```

   **Step 5.3: Determine if Fixes Needed**
   - IF consolidated assessment is "PASS":
     * Log: "[Component Name] passes design fidelity validation"
     * Move to next component
   - IF consolidated assessment is "NEEDS IMPROVEMENT" or "FAIL":
     * Proceed to Step 5.4 (Apply Fixes)

   **Step 5.4: Launch UI Developer to Apply Fixes**
   - Use Task tool with `subagent_type: frontend:ui-developer`
   - Provide complete context:
     ```
     Fix the UI implementation issues identified in the consolidated design review from multiple validation sources.

     **Component**: [Component Name]
     **Implementation File(s)**: [List of file paths]

     **CONSOLIDATED DESIGN REVIEW** (From Multiple Independent Sources):
     [Paste complete consolidated design review report from Step 5.2]

     This consolidated report includes findings from:
     - Designer Agent (human-style design expert)
     [If Codex enabled:]
     - Designer-Codex Agent (external Codex AI expert)

     Issues flagged by BOTH agents are highest priority and MUST be fixed.

     **Your Task:**
     1. Read all implementation files
     2. Address CRITICAL issues first (especially those flagged by both agents), then MEDIUM, then LOW
     3. Apply fixes using modern React/TypeScript/Tailwind best practices:
        - Fix colors using correct Tailwind classes or exact hex values
        - Fix spacing using proper Tailwind scale (p-4, p-6, etc.)
        - Fix typography (font sizes, weights, line heights)
        - Fix layout issues (max-width, alignment, grid/flex)
        - Fix accessibility (ARIA, contrast, keyboard nav)
        - Fix responsive design (mobile-first breakpoints)
     4. Use Edit tool to modify files
     5. Run quality checks (typecheck, lint, build)
     6. Provide implementation summary indicating:
        - Which issues were fixed
        - Which sources (designer, designer-codex, or both) flagged each issue
        - Files modified
        - Changes made

     DO NOT re-validate. Only apply the fixes.
     ```
   - Wait for ui-developer to complete fixes

   **Step 5.5: Check Loop Status**
   - Increment iteration count for this component
   - IF iteration < 3:
     * Loop back to Step 5.1 (re-run designer agents)
   - IF iteration = 3 AND issues still remain:
     * Ask user: "Component [Name] still has design issues after 3 iterations. How would you like to proceed?"
     * Options:
       - "Continue with current implementation (accept minor deviations)"
       - "Run 3 more iterations to refine further"
       - "Manual intervention needed"
     * Act based on user choice

   **End of Loop for Current Component**

   - Track metrics for each component:
     * Iterations used
     * Issues found and fixed
     * Final design fidelity score
     * Final assessment (PASS/NEEDS IMPROVEMENT)

**6. Quality Gate - All Components Validated**:
   - **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 2.5: Run design fidelity validation" as completed
   - **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 2.5: Quality gate - ensure UI matches design" as in_progress
   - IF all components passed design validation (PASS assessment):
     * Log: "✅ Automated design validation passed for all components"
     * **DO NOT mark quality gate as completed yet** - proceed to Step 7 for user validation (conditional based on user preference)
   - IF any component has FAIL assessment after max iterations:
     * Document which components failed
     * Ask user: "Some components failed design validation. Proceed anyway or iterate more?"
     * Act based on user choice

**7. User Manual Validation Gate** (Conditional based on user preference)

**Check Manual Validation Preference:**

IF `manual_validation_enabled` is FALSE (user chose "Fully automated"):
- Log: "✅ Automated design validation passed for all components! Skipping manual validation per user preference."
- **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 2.5: Quality gate" as completed
- Proceed to PHASE 3 (Triple Review Loop)
- Skip the rest of this step

IF `manual_validation_enabled` is TRUE (user chose "Include manual validation"):
- Proceed with manual validation below

**IMPORTANT**: When manual validation is enabled, the user must manually verify the implementation.

Even when designer agents claim "PASS" for all components, automated validation can miss subtle issues.

**Present to user:**

```
🎯 Automated Design Validation Passed - User Verification Required

The designer agent has validated all UI components and reports they match the design references.

However, automated validation can miss subtle issues. Please manually verify the implementation:

**Components to Check:**
[List each component with its Figma URL]
- [Component 1]: [Figma URL] → [Implementation file]
- [Component 2]: [Figma URL] → [Implementation file]
...

**What to Verify:**
1. Open the application at: [Application URL]
2. Navigate to each implemented component
3. Compare against the Figma design references
4. Check for:
   - Colors match exactly (backgrounds, text, borders)
   - Spacing and layout are pixel-perfect
   - Typography (fonts, sizes, weights, line heights) match
   - Visual elements (shadows, borders, icons) match
   - Interactive states work correctly (hover, focus, active, disabled)
   - Responsive design works on mobile, tablet, desktop
   - Accessibility features work properly (keyboard nav, ARIA)
   - Overall visual fidelity matches the design

**Validation Summary:**
- Components validated: [number]
- Total iterations: [sum of all component iterations]
- Average design fidelity score: [average score]/60
- All automated checks: PASS ✅

Please test the implementation and let me know:
```

Use AskUserQuestion to ask:
```
Do all UI components match their design references?

Please manually test each component against the Figma designs.

Options:
1. "Yes - All components look perfect" → Approve and continue
2. "No - I found issues in some components" → Provide feedback
```

**If user selects "Yes - All components look perfect":**
- Log: "✅ User approved all UI components! Design implementation verified by human review."
- **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 2.5: Quality gate" as completed
- Proceed to PHASE 3 (Triple Review Loop)

**If user selects "No - I found issues":**
- Ask user to specify which component(s) have issues:
  ```
  Which component(s) have issues?

  Please list the component names or numbers from the list above.

  Example: "Component 1 (UserProfile), Component 3 (Dashboard)"
  ```

- For EACH component with issues, ask for specific feedback:
  ```
  Please describe the issues you found in [Component Name]. You can provide:

  1. **Screenshot** - Path to a screenshot showing the issue(s)
  2. **Text Description** - Detailed description of what's wrong

  Example descriptions:
  - "The header background color is too light - should be #1a1a1a not #333333"
  - "Button spacing is wrong - there should be 24px gap not 16px"
  - "Font size on mobile is too small - headings should be 24px not 18px"
  - "The card shadow is missing - should match Figma shadow-lg"
  - "Profile avatar should be 64px not 48px"

  What issues did you find in [Component Name]?
  ```

- Collect user feedback for each problematic component
- Store as: `user_feedback_by_component = {component_name: feedback_text, ...}`

- For EACH component with user feedback:
  * Log: "⚠️ User found issues in [Component Name]. Launching UI Developer."
  * Use Task tool with `subagent_type: frontend:ui-developer`:
    ```
    Fix the UI implementation issues identified by the USER during manual testing.

    **CRITICAL**: These issues were found by a human reviewer, not automated validation.
    The user manually tested the implementation against the Figma design and found real problems.

    **Component**: [Component Name]
    **Design Reference**: [Figma URL]
    **Implementation File(s)**: [List of file paths]
    **Application URL**: [app_url]

    **USER FEEDBACK** (Human Manual Testing):
    [Paste user's complete feedback for this component]

    [If screenshot provided:]
    **User's Screenshot**: [screenshot_path]
    Please read the screenshot to understand the visual issues the user is pointing out.

    **Your Task:**
    1. Read the Figma design reference using Figma MCP
    2. Read all implementation files
    3. Carefully review the user's specific feedback
    4. Address EVERY issue the user mentioned:
       - If user mentioned colors: Fix to exact hex/Tailwind values
       - If user mentioned spacing: Fix to exact pixel values
       - If user mentioned typography: Fix font sizes, weights, line heights
       - If user mentioned layout: Fix alignment, max-width, grid/flex
       - If user mentioned visual elements: Fix shadows, borders, border-radius
       - If user mentioned interactive states: Fix hover, focus, active, disabled
       - If user mentioned responsive: Fix mobile, tablet, desktop breakpoints
       - If user mentioned accessibility: Fix ARIA, contrast, keyboard nav
    5. Use Edit tool to modify files
    6. Use modern React/TypeScript/Tailwind best practices:
       - React 19 patterns
       - Tailwind CSS 4 (utility-first, no @apply, static classes)
       - Mobile-first responsive design
       - WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility
    7. Run quality checks (typecheck, lint, build)
    8. Provide detailed summary explaining:
       - Each user issue addressed
       - Exact changes made
       - Files modified

    **IMPORTANT**: User feedback takes priority. The user has manually compared
    against the Figma design and seen real issues that automated validation missed.

    Return detailed fix summary when complete.
    ```

  * Wait for ui-developer to complete fixes

- After ALL components with user feedback are fixed:
  * Log: "All user-reported issues addressed. Re-running designer validation for affected components."
  * Re-run designer agent validation ONLY for components that had user feedback
  * Check if designer now reports PASS for those components
  * Ask user to verify fixes:
    ```
    I've addressed all the issues you reported. Please verify the fixes:

    [List components that were fixed]

    Do the fixes look correct now?
    ```

  * If user approves: Mark quality gate as completed, proceed to PHASE 3
  * If user still finds issues: Repeat user feedback collection and fixing

**End of Step 7 (User Manual Validation Gate)**

   - **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 2.5: Quality gate" as completed

**Design Fidelity Validation Summary** (to be included in final report):

#### PHASE 2.5-B: Test-Driven Feedback Loop (API_FOCUSED & MIXED Workflows)

**Applies to**: API_FOCUSED workflows, or API logic in MIXED workflows.
**Purpose**: Write and run automated tests BEFORE code review to catch implementation issues early.

**Philosophy**: No manual testing. Write focused Vitest tests, run them, analyze failures, and loop with developer until all tests pass.

**1. Launch Test-Architect**

- **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 2.5: Launch test-architect" as in_progress
- Use Task tool with `subagent_type: frontend:test-architect`
- Provide clear context:
  ```
  Task: Write and run comprehensive Vitest tests for the API implementation

  Context:
  - Feature: [brief description]
  - Implementation location: [files changed]
  - Architecture plan: [path to AI-DOCS plan]
  - Focus: API integration, data fetching, business logic, error handling

  Requirements:
  - Write focused unit tests for service functions
  - Write integration tests for API calls
  - Keep tests simple, fast, and maintainable
  - Mock external dependencies appropriately
  - Test edge cases and error scenarios

  After writing tests, RUN them with Vitest and analyze results.
  Provide structured output based on test results (see test-architect agent for output format).
  ```

**2. Analyze Test-Architect Output**

Test-architect will return one of four categories:

**CATEGORY A: TEST_ISSUE** (agent fixed it internally)
- Test-architect fixed test bugs and re-ran
- Tests now pass
- Proceed to step 3

**CATEGORY B: MISSING_CONTEXT**
- Tests cannot be written without clarification
- **Action**: Review missing information report
- Use AskUserQuestion to get clarification
- Re-launch test-architect with additional context
- Loop back to step 1

**CATEGORY C: IMPLEMENTATION_ISSUE** (developer must fix)
- Tests are correct but implementation has bugs
- Test-architect provides structured feedback with:
  * Specific failing tests
  * Root causes
  * Recommended fixes with code examples
- **Action**: Proceed to step 3 (feedback loop with developer)

**CATEGORY D: ALL_TESTS_PASS** (success!)
- All tests passing
- Implementation verified
- **Action**: Skip step 3, proceed to PHASE 3 (code review)

**3. Developer Feedback Loop** (Only for CATEGORY C: IMPLEMENTATION_ISSUE)

**IF tests revealed implementation issues:**

a. **Update TodoWrite**: Add iteration task:
   ```
   - content: "PHASE 2.5 - Iteration X: Fix implementation based on test failures"
     status: "in_progress"
     activeForm: "PHASE 2.5 - Iteration X: Fixing implementation based on test failures"
   ```

b. **Present test failure feedback to user** (optional, for transparency):
   ```markdown
   ## Test Results: Implementation Issues Found

   The test-architect wrote and executed tests. Some tests are failing due to implementation issues.

   **Test Summary:**
   - Total Tests: X
   - Passing: Y
   - Failing: Z

   **Issues Found:**
   [Brief summary of key issues]

   **Action**: Re-launching developer to fix implementation based on test feedback.
   ```

c. **Re-launch Developer** with test feedback:
   - Use Task tool with `subagent_type: frontend:developer`
   - Provide:
     * Original feature request
     * Architecture plan
     * Test failure analysis from test-architect
     * Specific issues that need fixing
     * Instruction to fix implementation and verify tests pass

d. **Re-run Tests** after developer fixes:
   - Re-launch test-architect to run tests again
   - Provide: "Re-run existing tests to verify fixes"
   - **Update TodoWrite**: Mark iteration as completed

e. **Loop Until Tests Pass**:
   - IF still failing: Repeat step 3 (add new iteration)
   - IF passing: Proceed to step 4
   - **Safety limit**: Max 3 iterations, then escalate to user

**4. Quality Gate: Ensure All Tests Pass**

- **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 2.5: Quality gate - ensure all tests pass" as in_progress
- Verify test-architect output shows `ALL_TESTS_PASS`
- Log test summary:
  ```markdown
  ✅ **PHASE 2.5 Complete: All Tests Passing**

  **Test Summary:**
  - Total Tests: X (all passing)
  - Unit Tests: Y
  - Integration Tests: Z
  - Test Execution Time: X seconds
  - Coverage: X%

  **Iterations Required**: X (if any)

  **Next Step**: Proceeding to code review (PHASE 3)
  ```
- **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 2.5: Quality gate" as completed
- **Proceed to PHASE 3**

**Test-Driven Feedback Loop Summary** (to be included in final report):
```markdown
## PHASE 2.5-B: Test-Driven Feedback Loop Results

**Status**: ✅ All tests passing
**Total Tests Written**: X
**Test Breakdown**:
- Unit Tests: Y
- Integration Tests: Z
**Test Execution Time**: X seconds
**Test Coverage**: X%

**Feedback Loop Iterations**: X
[If iterations > 0:]
- Iteration 1: [Brief description of issues found and fixed]
- Iteration 2: [Brief description]

**Key Test Coverage**:
- [List major behaviors/scenarios tested]
- [Edge cases covered]
- [Error handling validated]

**Outcome**: Implementation verified through automated testing. Ready for code review.
```

### PHASE 3: Review Loop (Adaptive Based on Workflow Type)

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW ROUTING**: This phase adapts based on the `workflow_type` detected in STEP 0.5.

#### Workflow-Specific Review Strategy:

**For API_FOCUSED workflows:**
- Launch **(1 + configured external models)** code reviewers - **SKIP UI tester**
- Default: 3 reviewers (Claude Sonnet + Grok + GPT-5 Codex)
- Review focus: API logic, type safety, error handling, data validation, HTTP patterns
- Multi-model perspective: Get independent code reviews from different AI models
- Configurable via `pluginSettings.frontend.reviewModels` in `.claude/settings.json`

**For UI_FOCUSED workflows:**
- Launch **(1 + configured external models + 1 UI tester)** reviewers
- Default: 4 reviewers (Claude Sonnet + Grok + GPT-5 Codex + UI tester)
- Review focus: UI code quality, visual implementation, user interactions, browser testing
- Multi-model perspective: Multiple code reviews + browser testing

**For MIXED workflows:**
- Launch **(1 + configured external models + 1 UI tester)** reviewers
- Default: 4 reviewers (Claude Sonnet + Grok + GPT-5 Codex + UI tester)
- Review focus: Both API logic AND UI implementation, plus integration points
- Multi-model perspective: Comprehensive coverage across all aspects

---

1. **Prepare Review Context**:
   - **Read Review Models Configuration**:
     * Try to read `.claude/settings.json` to get `pluginSettings.frontend.reviewModels` array
     * IF found: Use configured models (e.g., `["grok-fast", "code-review"]`)
     * IF not found or empty: Use default models `["grok-fast", "code-review"]`
     * Store as `external_review_models` array for use in parallel execution
   - **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 3: Launch reviewers in parallel" as in_progress
     * If API_FOCUSED: Update todo text to "Launch X code reviewers in parallel (Claude + {external_review_models.length} external models)"
     * If UI_FOCUSED or MIXED: Update todo text to "Launch X reviewers in parallel (Claude + {external_review_models.length} external models + UI tester)"
   - Run `git status` to identify all unstaged changes
   - Run `git diff` to capture the COMPLETE implementation changes
   - Read planning documentation from AI-DOCS folder to get 2-3 sentence summary
   - IF workflow is UI_FOCUSED or MIXED: Retrieve the manual testing instructions from Step 3 of Phase 2
   - Prepare this context for reviewers

2. **Launch Reviewers in Parallel (Workflow-Adaptive)**:

   **IF `workflow_type` is "API_FOCUSED":**
   - **CRITICAL**: Use a single message with (1 + external_review_models.length) Task tool calls to run code reviews in parallel with different models
   - **DO NOT launch UI tester** - no UI testing needed for API-only work
   - Log: "🔍 Launching {1 + external_review_models.length} code reviewers with multi-model analysis: Claude Sonnet + {external_review_models.join(', ')} (UI tester skipped for API-focused workflow)"

   **Parallel Execution for API_FOCUSED**:
   ```
   Send a single message with (1 + external_review_models.length) Task calls:

   Task 1: Launch reviewer (normal Claude Sonnet - no PROXY_MODE)
   Task 2: Launch reviewer with PROXY_MODE: {external_review_models[0]} (e.g., grok-fast)
   Task 3: Launch reviewer with PROXY_MODE: {external_review_models[1]} (e.g., code-review)
   ... (repeat for each model in external_review_models array)
   ```

   **IF `workflow_type` is "UI_FOCUSED" or "MIXED":**
   - **CRITICAL**: Use a single message with (1 + external_review_models.length + 1) Task tool calls to run all reviews in parallel
   - Log: "🔍 Launching {1 + external_review_models.length + 1} reviewers with multi-model analysis: Claude Sonnet + {external_review_models.join(', ')} + UI tester"

   **Parallel Execution for UI_FOCUSED or MIXED**:
   ```
   Send a single message with (1 + external_review_models.length + 1) Task calls:

   Task 1: Launch reviewer (normal Claude Sonnet - no PROXY_MODE)
   Task 2: Launch reviewer with PROXY_MODE: {external_review_models[0]} (e.g., grok-fast)
   Task 3: Launch reviewer with PROXY_MODE: {external_review_models[1]} (e.g., code-review)
   ... (repeat for each model in external_review_models array)
   Task N: Launch tester (UI testing)
   ```

   - **Reviewer 1 - Claude Sonnet Code Reviewer (Comprehensive Human-Focused Review)**:
     * Use Task tool with `subagent_type: frontend:reviewer`
     * **DO NOT include PROXY_MODE directive** - this runs with normal Claude Sonnet
     * Provide context:
       - "Review all unstaged git changes from the current implementation"
       - Path to the original plan for reference (AI-DOCS/...)
       - Workflow type: [API_FOCUSED | UI_FOCUSED | MIXED]
       - Request comprehensive review against:
         * Simplicity principles
         * OWASP security standards
         * React and TypeScript best practices
         * Code quality and maintainability
         * Alignment with the approved plan
       - **IF API_FOCUSED**: Add specific focus areas:
         * API integration patterns and error handling
         * Type safety for API requests/responses
         * Loading and error states
         * Data validation and transformation
         * HTTP request/response handling
         * Security: input sanitization, XSS prevention, API token handling
       - **IF UI_FOCUSED**: Add specific focus areas:
         * Component structure and reusability
         * React patterns and hooks usage
         * Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
         * Responsive design implementation
         * User interaction patterns

   - **Reviewers 2..N - External AI Code Analyzers (via Claudish MCP + OpenRouter)**:
     * For EACH model in `external_review_models` array (e.g., ["grok-fast", "code-review"]):
       - Use Task tool with `subagent_type: frontend:reviewer`
       - **CRITICAL**: Start the prompt with `PROXY_MODE: {model_name}` directive
       - The agent will automatically delegate to the external AI model via Claudish MCP
       - Provide the same review context as Reviewer 1:
         * Full prompt format (see Reviewer 1 above for structure)
         * Same workflow type, planning context, focus areas
         * Git diff output and review standards
       - Format:
         ```
         PROXY_MODE: {model_name}

         [Include all the same context and instructions as Reviewer 1]
         ```
     * Example for `external_review_models = ["grok-fast", "code-review"]`:
       - Reviewer 2: PROXY_MODE: grok-fast (xAI Grok)
       - Reviewer 3: PROXY_MODE: code-review (OpenAI GPT-5 Codex)
     * The number of external reviewers = `external_review_models.length`

   - **Reviewer 4 - UI Manual Tester (Real Browser Testing)**:
     * **ONLY for UI_FOCUSED or MIXED workflows** - Skip for API_FOCUSED
     * Use Task tool with `subagent_type: frontend:tester`
     * Provide context:
       - **Manual testing instructions** from Phase 2 Step 3 (the structured guide from developer)
       - Application URL (e.g., http://localhost:5173 or staging URL)
       - Feature being tested (e.g., "User Management Feature")
       - Planning context from AI-DOCS for understanding expected behavior
     * The agent will:
       - Follow the step-by-step testing instructions provided
       - Use specific UI selectors (aria-labels, data-testid) mentioned in instructions
       - Verify expected visual outcomes
       - Check console output against expected logs
       - Validate with provided test data
       - Report any discrepancies, UI bugs, console errors, or unexpected behavior
     * Testing should be efficient and focused (no excessive screenshots or deep analysis)
     * Results should include:
       - ✅ Steps that passed with expected outcomes
       - ❌ Steps that failed with actual vs expected outcomes
       - Console errors or warnings found
       - UI/UX issues discovered
       - Overall assessment: PASS / FAIL / PARTIAL

3. **Collect and Analyze Review Results** (Workflow-Adaptive):
   - **IF API_FOCUSED**: Wait for (1 + external_review_models.length) code reviewers to complete (Claude Sonnet + external models)
   - **IF UI_FOCUSED or MIXED**: Wait for (1 + external_review_models.length + 1) reviewers to complete (Claude Sonnet + external models + UI tester)
   - **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 3: Launch reviewers" as completed
   - **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 3: Analyze review results" as in_progress
   - **Claude Sonnet Reviewer Feedback**: Document comprehensive findings and recommendations
   - **For EACH external model** in `external_review_models`:
     * Document that model's findings and recommendations (via OpenRouter)
     * Note the model name (e.g., "grok-fast review", "code-review results")
   - **IF UI_FOCUSED or MIXED**: **UI Manual Tester Feedback**: Document all testing results, UI bugs, and console errors
   - **IF API_FOCUSED**: Note that UI testing was skipped for API-only implementation
   - **Combined Multi-Model Analysis**:
     * Merge and deduplicate issues from all reviewers
     * Categorize by severity (critical, major, minor)
     * Identify overlapping concerns (higher confidence when multiple reviewers find the same issue)
     * Note unique findings from each reviewer:
       - Code review findings (logic, security, quality)
       - Automated analysis findings (patterns, best practices)
       - **IF UI_FOCUSED or MIXED**: UI testing findings (runtime behavior, user experience, console errors)
     * **IF UI_FOCUSED or MIXED**: Cross-reference: UI bugs may reveal code issues, console errors may indicate missing error handling
   - **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 3: Analyze review results" as completed

4. **Review Feedback Loop** (Workflow-Adaptive):
   - **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 3: Quality gate - ensure all reviewers approved" as in_progress
   - IF **ANY** reviewer identifies issues:
     * Document all feedback clearly from ALL reviewers (2 or 3 depending on workflow)
     * Categorize and prioritize the combined feedback:
       - **Code issues** (from reviewer and codex)
       - **UI/runtime issues** (from tester)
       - **Console errors** (from tester)
     * **Update TodoWrite**: Add "PHASE 3 - Iteration X: Fix issues and re-run reviewers" task
     * **CRITICAL**: Do NOT fix issues yourself - delegate to developer agent
     * **Launch developer agent** using Task tool with:
       - Original plan reference (path to AI-DOCS)
       - Combined feedback from ALL reviewers:
         * Code review feedback (logic, security, quality issues)
         * Automated analysis feedback (patterns, best practices)
         * **IF UI_FOCUSED or MIXED**: UI testing feedback (runtime bugs, console errors, UX issues)
       - Clear instruction: "Fix all issues identified by reviewers"
       - Priority order for fixes (Critical first, then Medium, then Minor)
       - **IF UI_FOCUSED or MIXED**: Note: Some UI bugs may require code changes, console errors may indicate missing error handling
       - Instruction to run quality checks after fixes
     * After developer completes fixes:
       - **IF UI_FOCUSED or MIXED**: Request updated manual testing instructions if implementation changed significantly
       - Re-run reviewers in parallel (loop back to step 2):
         * **IF API_FOCUSED**: Re-run TWO code reviewers only
         * **IF UI_FOCUSED or MIXED**: Re-run ALL THREE reviewers
     * Repeat until all reviewers approve
   - IF **ALL** reviewers approve (2 or 3 depending on workflow):
     * **IF API_FOCUSED**: Document that dual code review passed (code review + automated analysis)
     * **IF UI_FOCUSED or MIXED**: Document that triple review passed (code review + automated analysis + manual UI testing)
     * **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 3: Quality gate - ensure all reviewers approved" as completed
     * Proceed to Phase 4
   - **Track loop iterations** (document how many review cycles occurred and feedback from each reviewer)

   **REMINDER**: You are orchestrating. You do NOT fix code yourself. Always use Task to delegate to developer.

### PHASE 4: Testing Loop (test-architect)

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW ROUTING**: Testing approach depends on `workflow_type`.

**For API_FOCUSED workflows:**
- **SKIP THIS PHASE ENTIRELY** - All testing completed in PHASE 2.5-B (Test-Driven Feedback Loop)
- **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 4: Launch test-architect" as completed with note: "Skipped - API_FOCUSED workflow completed testing in PHASE 2.5"
- **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 4: Quality gate - ensure all tests pass" as completed with note: "Already verified in PHASE 2.5"
- Log: "✅ PHASE 4 skipped - API_FOCUSED workflow. All tests already written, executed, and passing from PHASE 2.5."
- **Proceed directly to PHASE 5**

**For UI_FOCUSED workflows:**
- Focus on: Component tests, user interaction tests, accessibility tests, visual regression tests
- Continue with test-architect as described below

**For MIXED workflows:**
- API tests already done in PHASE 2.5-B
- Focus remaining testing on: UI component tests, visual tests, integration tests between UI and API
- May include: Minimal API mocking for data-dependent UI components

---

1. **Launch Testing Agent**:
   - **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 4: Launch test-architect" as in_progress
   - Use Task tool with `subagent_type: frontend:test-architect`
   - Provide:
     * Implemented code (reference to files)
     * Original plan requirements
     * Workflow type: [API_FOCUSED | UI_FOCUSED | MIXED]
     * **IF API_FOCUSED**: Emphasize API testing focus (unit tests for services, integration tests, error handling, mock responses)
     * **IF UI_FOCUSED**: Emphasize UI testing focus (component tests, user interactions, accessibility, visual elements)
     * **IF MIXED**: Request both API and UI test coverage
     * Instruction to create comprehensive test coverage
     * Instruction to run all tests

2. **Test Results Analysis**:
   - Agent writes tests and executes them
   - Analyzes test results
   - **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 4: Launch test-architect" as completed
   - **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 4: Quality gate - ensure all tests pass" as in_progress

3. **Test Feedback Loop** (Inner Loop):
   - IF tests fail due to implementation bugs:
     * **Update TodoWrite**: Add "PHASE 4 - Iteration X: Fix implementation bugs and re-test" task
     * Document the test failures and root cause analysis
     * **CRITICAL**: Do NOT fix bugs yourself - delegate to developer agent
     * **Launch developer agent** using Task tool with:
       - Test failure details (which tests failed, error messages, stack traces)
       - Root cause analysis from test architect
       - Instruction: "Fix implementation bugs causing test failures"
       - Original plan reference
       - Instruction to run quality checks after fixes
     * After developer completes fixes, re-run BOTH reviewers in parallel (Loop back to Phase 3)
     * After code review approval, re-run test-architect
     * Repeat until all tests pass
   - IF tests fail due to test issues (not implementation):
     * **Update TodoWrite**: Add "PHASE 4 - Iteration X: Fix test issues" task
     * **Launch test-architect agent** using Task tool to fix the test code
     * Re-run tests after test fixes
   - IF all tests pass:
     * **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 4: Quality gate - ensure all tests pass" as completed
     * Proceed to Phase 5
   - **Track loop iterations** (document how many test-fix cycles occurred)

   **REMINDER**: You are orchestrating. You do NOT fix implementation bugs yourself. Always use Task to delegate to developer.

### PHASE 5: User Review & Project Cleanup

1. **User Final Review Gate**:
   - **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 5: User approval gate - present implementation for final review" as in_progress
   - Present the completed implementation to the user:
     * Summary of what was implemented
     * All code review approvals received (reviewer + codex)
     * Manual UI testing passed (tester)
     * All automated tests passing confirmation (vitest)
     * Key files created/modified
   - Use AskUserQuestion to ask: "Are you satisfied with this implementation? All code has been reviewed, UI tested manually, and automated tests pass."
   - Options: "Yes, proceed to cleanup and finalization" / "No, I need changes"

2. **User Feedback Loop**:
   - IF user not satisfied:
     * Collect specific feedback on what needs to change
     * **Update TodoWrite**: Add "PHASE 5 - Iteration X: Address user feedback" task
     * **CRITICAL**: Do NOT make changes yourself - delegate to appropriate agent
     * Determine which agent to use based on feedback type:
       - If architectural changes needed: **Launch architect** (Loop back to Phase 1)
       - If implementation changes needed: **Launch developer** with user feedback (Loop back to Phase 2)
       - If only test changes needed: **Launch test-architect** (Loop back to Phase 4)
     * After agent addresses feedback, go through subsequent phases again
     * Repeat until user is satisfied
   - IF user satisfied:
     * **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 5: User approval gate - present implementation for final review" as completed
     * Proceed to cleanup
   - **DO NOT proceed to cleanup without user approval**

   **REMINDER**: You are orchestrating. You do NOT implement user feedback yourself. Always use Task to delegate to the appropriate agent.

3. **Launch Project Cleanup**:
   - **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 5: Launch cleaner to clean up temporary artifacts" as in_progress
   - Use Task tool with `subagent_type: frontend:cleaner`
   - Provide context:
     * The implementation is complete and user-approved
     * Request cleanup of:
       - Temporary test files
       - Development artifacts
       - Intermediate documentation
       - Any scaffolding or setup scripts
     * Preserve:
       - Final implementation code
       - Final tests
       - User-facing documentation
       - Configuration files

4. **Cleanup Completion**:
   - Agent removes temporary files and provides cleanup summary
   - **Update TodoWrite**: Mark "PHASE 5: Launch cleaner to clean up temporary artifacts" as completed
   - Proceed to Phase 6 for final summary

## Orchestration Rules

### Agent Communication:
- Each agent receives context from previous phases
- Document decisions and rationale throughout
- Maintain a workflow log showing agent transitions

### Loop Prevention (Workflow-Adaptive):
- **IF UI_FOCUSED or MIXED**: Maximum 3 design fidelity iterations per component before escalating to user
- **IF API_FOCUSED**: Design fidelity validation skipped entirely
- Maximum 3 code review cycles before escalating to user:
  * **IF API_FOCUSED**: Dual review cycles (code + codex)
  * **IF UI_FOCUSED or MIXED**: Triple review cycles (code + codex + UI testing)
- Maximum 5 automated test-fix cycles before escalating to user
- If loops exceed limits, ask user for guidance

### Error Handling:
- If any agent encounters blocking errors, pause and ask user for guidance
- Document all blockers clearly with context
- Provide options for resolution

### Git Hygiene:
- All work happens on unstaged changes until final approval
- Do not commit during the workflow
- Preserve git state for review analysis

### Quality Gates (Workflow-Adaptive):

**Universal Gates (all workflows):**
- User approval required after Phase 1 (architecture plan)
- Code review approvals required before Phase 4 (Phase 3 gate)
- All automated tests must pass before Phase 5 (Phase 4 gate)
- User approval required after Phase 5 (final implementation review)

**UI-Specific Gates (UI_FOCUSED or MIXED workflows only):**
- ALL UI components must match design specifications (Phase 2.5 gate - if Figma links present)
- **User manual validation of UI components (Phase 2.5 gate - if Figma links present and manual validation enabled)**
  - If manual validation enabled: User must explicitly approve: "Yes - All components look perfect"
  - If fully automated: Trust designer agents' validation
- **ALL THREE** reviewer approvals required (reviewer AND Codex AND tester)
- Manual UI testing passed with no critical issues

**API-Specific Gates (API_FOCUSED workflows):**
- **SKIP** Phase 2.5 entirely (no design validation for API-only work)
- **TWO** reviewer approvals required (reviewer AND Codex only - tester skipped)
- **SKIP** manual UI testing (no UI changes to test)

## Success Criteria (Workflow-Adaptive)

The command is complete when:
1. ✅ User approved the architecture plan (Phase 1 gate)
2. ✅ Implementation follows the approved plan
3. ✅ **IF UI_FOCUSED or MIXED**: Manual testing instructions generated by implementation agent
4. ✅ **IF UI_FOCUSED or MIXED**: ALL UI components match design specifications (Phase 2.5 gate - if Figma present)
5. ✅ **IF UI_FOCUSED or MIXED with Figma**: UI validation complete
   - If manual validation enabled: User manually validated UI components
   - If fully automated: Designer agents validated UI components
6. ✅ **Code review approvals (Phase 3 gate)**:
   - **IF API_FOCUSED**: TWO reviewers approved (code + codex) - UI tester skipped
   - **IF UI_FOCUSED or MIXED**: ALL THREE reviewers approved (code + codex + tester)
7. ✅ **IF UI_FOCUSED or MIXED**: Manual UI testing passed with no critical issues
8. ✅ **IF API_FOCUSED**: API integration tested (no UI testing needed)
9. ✅ All automated tests written and passing (Phase 4 gate)
   - **IF API_FOCUSED**: API service tests, integration tests, error scenarios
   - **IF UI_FOCUSED**: Component tests, interaction tests, accessibility tests
   - **IF MIXED**: Both API and UI test coverage
10. ✅ User approved the final implementation (Phase 5 gate)
11. ✅ Project cleanup completed successfully
12. ✅ Comprehensive workflow-specific summary provided
13. ✅ User acknowledges completion

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW NOTES**:
- **API_FOCUSED workflows**: Phase 2.5 (design validation) is completely skipped. UI tester is skipped in Phase 3. Success depends on API logic quality, not visual fidelity.
- **UI_FOCUSED workflows**: Full design validation and UI testing. Success depends on matching design specifications and user experience quality.
- **MIXED workflows**: Both design validation (for UI parts) and API review (for logic parts). Success depends on both visual fidelity and API integration quality.

## Examples: Correct vs Incorrect Orchestrator Behavior

### ❌ INCORRECT: Orchestrator Trying to Fix Code Directly

```
Scenario: Code reviewer finds a TypeScript type error

WRONG BEHAVIOR:
> I see the reviewer found a type error in src/api/mockUserApi.ts.
> Let me quickly fix that.
>
> Edit(file_path: "src/api/mockUserApi.ts", old_string: "...", new_string: "...")
>
> Fixed! Now re-running reviewers...
```

**Why this is wrong**: The orchestrator used Edit tool to fix code directly instead of delegating to developer agent.

### ✅ CORRECT: Orchestrator Delegating to Agent

```
Scenario: Code reviewer finds a TypeScript type error

CORRECT BEHAVIOR:
> I see the reviewer found a type error in src/api/mockUserApi.ts.
> I need to delegate this fix to the developer agent.
>
> Task(
>   subagent_type: "frontend:developer",
>   prompt: "Fix the TypeScript type error identified by code reviewer:
>
>   File: src/api/mockUserApi.ts
>   Issue: Return type of getUsers() should be Promise<User[]> not Promise<any>
>
>   Please fix this type error and run quality checks."
> )
```

**Why this is correct**: The orchestrator delegated the fix to developer agent using the Task tool.

### ❌ INCORRECT: Orchestrator Creating New Files

```
Scenario: Need to create a new utility file

WRONG BEHAVIOR:
> I'll create a new utility file for date formatting.
>
> Write(
>   file_path: "src/lib/dateUtils.ts",
>   content: "export function formatDate(date: Date) { ... }"
> )
```

**Why this is wrong**: The orchestrator created a file directly instead of delegating to developer agent.

### ✅ CORRECT: Orchestrator Delegating File Creation

```
Scenario: Need to create a new utility file

CORRECT BEHAVIOR:
> I need a new utility file for date formatting.
> I'll delegate this to the developer agent.
>
> Task(
>   subagent_type: "frontend:developer",
>   prompt: "Create a new utility file src/lib/dateUtils.ts with date formatting functions.
>
>   Include:
>   - formatDate(date: Date): string - format to YYYY-MM-DD
>   - formatDateTime(date: Date): string - format to YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss
>
>   Follow existing project patterns and run quality checks."
> )
```

**Why this is correct**: The orchestrator delegated file creation to developer agent.

### ❌ INCORRECT: Orchestrator Analyzing and Fixing Test Failures

```
Scenario: Tests are failing

WRONG BEHAVIOR:
> Tests are failing in UserForm.test.ts. Let me read the test file
> and the implementation to understand the issue.
>
> Read(file_path: "src/components/users/UserForm.test.ts")
> Read(file_path: "src/components/users/UserForm.tsx")
>
> I see the problem - the onChange handler expects a different signature.
> Let me fix it:
>
> Edit(file_path: "src/components/users/UserForm.tsx", ...)
```

**Why this is wrong**: The orchestrator analyzed the issue and fixed it directly instead of delegating to developer agent.

### ✅ CORRECT: Orchestrator Delegating Test Failure Resolution

```
Scenario: Tests are failing

CORRECT BEHAVIOR:
> Tests are failing in UserForm component. The test-architect
> has identified that the onChange handler signature is incorrect.
>
> I'll delegate this implementation bug fix to developer.
>
> Task(
>   subagent_type: "frontend:developer",
>   prompt: "Fix implementation bugs causing test failures:
>
>   Test File: src/components/users/UserForm.test.ts
>   Implementation: src/components/users/UserForm.tsx
>
>   Issue: onChange handler signature mismatch
>   Expected: (field: string, value: string) => void
>   Actual: (value: string) => void
>
>   Please fix the implementation and ensure all tests pass."
> )
```

**Why this is correct**: The orchestrator delegated the bug fix to developer agent with clear context.

### Summary of Orchestrator Role

**YOU ARE**: A workflow coordinator who launches agents and manages quality gates
**YOU ARE NOT**: An implementer who writes or fixes code

**YOUR JOB**:
- Run git commands to understand changes
- Read planning docs to gather context
- Launch agents with Task tool
- Track progress with TodoWrite
- Manage quality gates with AskUserQuestion
- Present summaries and results to user

**NOT YOUR JOB**:
- Write code
- Edit code
- Fix bugs
- Create files
- Refactor code
- Analyze implementation details

**When in doubt**: Use Task to delegate to an agent!

## Notes

- This is a long-running orchestration - expect multiple agent invocations

### Workflow Detection (NEW in v2.7.0)

- **STEP 0.5: Intelligent Workflow Detection** automatically classifies tasks as:
  * **API_FOCUSED**: API integration, data fetching, business logic (skips design validation and UI testing)
  * **UI_FOCUSED**: UI components, styling, visual design (full design validation and UI testing)
  * **MIXED**: Both API and UI work (validates UI parts, reviews both API and UI code)
- The workflow type determines which agents run and which phases are executed
- **For API-only work**: Design validation (PHASE 2.5) is completely skipped, UI tester is skipped in PHASE 3
- **For UI work**: Full design validation and UI testing workflow
- If workflow is unclear, the orchestrator asks the user to clarify

### Design Fidelity Validation (PHASE 2.5)

- **PHASE 2.5 (Design Fidelity Validation)** is conditional:
  * **ONLY runs for UI_FOCUSED or MIXED workflows** with Figma design links
  * **COMPLETELY SKIPPED for API_FOCUSED workflows** (no UI changes to validate)
  * Uses designer agent to review implementation vs design reference
  * Uses ui-developer agent to fix visual/UX discrepancies
  * Optional ui-developer-codex agent provides third-party expert review
  * Maximum 3 iterations per component before escalating to user
  * Ensures pixel-perfect implementation before code review phase

### Adaptive Review Process (PHASE 3)

- **CRITICAL**: Reviewer execution adapts to workflow type:

  **For API_FOCUSED workflows** (TWO reviewers in parallel):
  * Task 1: `subagent_type: frontend:reviewer` (code review focused on API logic, error handling, types)
  * Task 2: `subagent_type: frontend:codex-reviewer` (automated analysis of API patterns)
  * **SKIP Task 3** (frontend:tester) - No UI testing needed for API-only work
  * Both Task calls in SAME message for parallel execution

  **For UI_FOCUSED or MIXED workflows** (THREE reviewers in parallel):
  * Task 1: `subagent_type: frontend:reviewer` (human-focused code review using Sonnet)
  * Task 2: `subagent_type: frontend:codex-reviewer` (automated AI code review using Codex)
  * Task 3: `subagent_type: frontend:tester` (real browser manual UI testing with Chrome DevTools)
  * All THREE Task calls must be in SAME message for true parallel execution

- Before running tester (UI workflows only), ensure you have manual testing instructions from the implementation agent
- Maintain clear communication with user at each quality gate
- Document all decisions and iterations from reviewers
- Be transparent about any compromises or trade-offs made
- If anything is unclear during execution, ask the user rather than making assumptions

### Review System Perspectives

- The review system provides comprehensive validation through independent perspectives:
  * **reviewer**: Traditional human-style review with 15+ years experience (code quality, architecture, security)
    - For API_FOCUSED: Focuses on API integration, type safety, error handling
    - For UI_FOCUSED: Focuses on component quality, accessibility, responsive design
  * **codex-reviewer**: Automated AI analysis using Codex models (best practices, potential bugs)
    - For API_FOCUSED: Analyzes API patterns, HTTP handling, data validation
    - For UI_FOCUSED: Analyzes React patterns, UI code quality, visual consistency
  * **tester** (UI_FOCUSED/MIXED only): Real browser testing with manual interaction (runtime behavior, UI/UX, console errors)
    - Follows specific testing instructions with accessibility selectors
    - Catches runtime issues that static code review cannot detect
    - Console errors often reveal missing error handling or race conditions

### Other Important Notes

- The cleaner agent runs only after user approval to ensure no important artifacts are removed prematurely
- User approval gates ensure the user stays in control of the implementation direction and final deliverable
- Workflow type is logged and included in final summary for transparency
