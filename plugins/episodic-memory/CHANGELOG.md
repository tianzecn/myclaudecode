## [1.0.15] - 2025-12-17

### Changed
- **Stop shipping package-lock.json**: Removed from git tracking so npm generates platform-appropriate lockfile on install
- **Remove file deletion from MCP wrapper**: No longer deletes package-lock.json on first run (unnecessary without shipped lockfile)

## [1.0.14] - 2025-12-16

### Fixed
- **Windows spawn ENOENT error**: Add `shell` option for npx commands on Windows (#36, thanks @andrewcchoi!)
  - On Windows, npx is a .cmd file requiring `shell: true` for spawn() to work
  - Applied fix to `cli/episodic-memory.js` and `cli/index-conversations.js`
  - Resolves plugin initialization failures and silent SessionStart hook failures on Windows
- **Agent conversations polluting search index**: Add exclusion marker to summarizer prompts (#15, thanks @one1zero1one!)
  - Summarizer agent conversations are now properly excluded from indexing
  - Extracted marker to shared constant (`SUMMARIZER_CONTEXT_MARKER`) for maintainability
- **Background sync silently failing**: CLI now uses compiled JS instead of tsx at runtime (#25 root cause, thanks @stromseth for identifying!)
  - `--background` flag on sync command now works correctly
  - Fixes SessionStart hook auto-sync that was silently failing
- **Directory auto-creation**: Config directories are now created automatically (inspired by #18, thanks @gingerbeardman!)
  - `getSuperpowersDir()`, `getArchiveDir()`, `getIndexDir()` now ensure directories exist
  - Prevents errors on fresh installs where directories don't exist yet

### Changed
- **CLI uses compiled JavaScript**: Remove tsx from runtime path
  - All CLI commands now route through `dist/*.js` instead of `npx tsx src/*.ts`
  - Faster startup, lighter runtime dependencies
  - tsx is now dev-only (for tests and development)
  - Obsoletes PR #25 (background sync fix) by fixing root cause
- **CLI architecture cleanup**: Replace bash scripts with Node.js wrappers
  - All CLI entry points (`episodic-memory`, `index-conversations`, `search-conversations`, `mcp-server`) are now Node.js scripts
  - Eliminates bash dependency entirely for full cross-platform support (Windows, NixOS, etc.)
  - SessionStart hook now calls `node cli/episodic-memory.js` directly
  - Added `search-conversations.js` to complete Node.js CLI coverage
  - Obsoletes PRs #29 (pnpm workspace), #11 (env bash), and #17 (shebang fix)

## [1.0.13] - 2025-11-22

### Fixed
- **MCP server startup error**: Fix "Invalid or unexpected token" error when starting MCP server
  - Changed plugin.json to use `cli/mcp-server-wrapper.js` instead of bash script `cli/mcp-server`
  - MCP server configuration was pointing to bash script which was being executed with `node` command
  - Wrapper script properly handles Node.js execution and runs bundled `dist/mcp-server.js`

## [1.0.12] - 2025-11-22

### Changed
- **Skill triggering behavior**: Improved episodic memory skill to trigger at appropriate times
  - Changed from "ALWAYS USE THIS SKILL WHEN STARTING ANY KIND OF WORK" to contextual triggers
  - Now triggers when user asks for approach/decision after exploring code
  - Now triggers when stuck on complex problems after investigating
  - Now triggers for unfamiliar workflows or explicit historical references
  - Prevents premature memory searches before understanding current codebase
  - Empirically tested with subagents: 5/5 scenarios passed vs 3/5 with previous description

## [1.0.11] - 2025-11-20

### Fixed
- **Plugin Configuration**: Fix duplicate hooks file error in Claude Code
  - Remove duplicate `"hooks": "./hooks/hooks.json"` reference from plugin.json
  - Claude Code automatically loads hooks/hooks.json, so manifest should only reference additional hook files
  - Update MCP server reference from obsolete `mcp-server-wrapper.js` to direct `mcp-server` script

### Changed
- Simplified plugin.json configuration for cleaner Claude Code integration

## [1.0.10] - 2025-11-20

### Fixed
- **Search result formatting**: Prevent Claude's Read tool 256KB limit failures
  - Search results now include file metadata (size in KB, total line count)
  - Changed from verbose 3-line format to clean 1-line: "Lines 10-25 in /path/file.jsonl (295.7KB, 1247 lines)"
  - Removes prescriptive MCP tool instructions, trusting Claude to choose correct tool based on file size
  - Eliminates issue where episodic memory search triggered built-in Read tool instead of specialized MCP read tool

### Changed
- Enhanced `formatResults()` and `formatMultiConceptResults()` with async file metadata collection
- Added efficient streaming line counting and file size utilities
