Subject: Claude Code Plugin Partnership - tianzecn

Hi Anthropic Team,

I'm tianzecn from tianzecn. We've developed a suite of Claude Code
plugins focused on code analysis and multi-agent orchestration.

Our flagship plugin (code-analysis v2.6.0) integrates claudemem for AST-based
codebase understanding with PageRank symbol ranking - something unique in
the current plugin ecosystem.

We'd love to discuss inclusion in the official claude-plugins-official
repository. Our plugins are:
- Production-tested with multi-model validation
- MIT licensed
- Fully documented (6,000+ lines)

Repository: https://github.com/tianzecn/myclaudecode

Would there be an appropriate channel to discuss this?

Best,
tianzecn
