## Deep Thinking: Design Philosophy

### Core Challenge Identified

The claude-context MCP is a powerful but complex tool. Users need guidance on:

1. **When to use it** - Not always the right tool
2. **How to index properly** - AST vs LangChain, custom extensions, ignore patterns
3. **How to query effectively** - Semantic vs keyword searches
4. **How to optimize performance** - 40% token reduction requires technique
5. **How to troubleshoot** - Node version conflicts, indexing failures, poor results
6. **How to integrate** - Seamless workflow with codebase-detective and other tools

### Design Principles Applied

#### 1. **Decision-First Approach**

**Problem:** Users might use semantic search when grep would be faster.

**Solution:** Phase 1 provides clear decision criteria:
```markdown
Use Claude-Context When:
✅ Codebase is large (10k+ lines)
✅ Need to find functionality by concept
✅ Token budget is limited

DON'T Use Claude-Context When:
❌ Searching for exact string matches (use grep)
❌ Codebase is small (<5k lines)
❌ Looking for specific file names (use find)
```

#### 2. **Practical Examples Over Theory**

**Problem:** Abstract documentation doesn't help in real situations.

**Solution:** Every concept includes concrete examples:
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD - Semantic concept
search_code with query: "user authentication login flow with JWT tokens"

// ❌ BAD - Too generic
search_code with query: "user"
```

#### 3. **Progressive Complexity**

**Problem:** Overwhelming users with all options at once.

**Solution:** Structured phases from basic to advanced:
- Phase 1: Decide if appropriate
- Phase 2: Basic indexing
- Phase 3: Query formulation
- Phase 4: Performance optimization
- Phase 5: Integration patterns
- Phase 6: Troubleshooting
- Phase 7: Real-world workflows
- Phase 8: Best practices summary

#### 4. **Safety and User Confirmation**

**Problem:** Force re-indexing can overwrite important indexes.

**Solution:** Built-in confirmation pattern:
```markdown
⚠️ Conflict Handling:
If indexing is attempted on an already indexed path, ALWAYS:
1. Inform the user that the path is already indexed
2. Ask if they want to force re-index
3. Explain the trade-off (time vs freshness)
4. Only proceed with force: true if user confirms
```

#### 5. **Performance-Conscious Design**

**Problem:** Semantic search can still consume tokens if used poorly.

**Solution:** Token optimization techniques throughout:
- Technique 1: Targeted searches vs full directory reads (90% savings)
- Technique 2: Iterative refinement (search → refine → search)
- Technique 3: Combine semantic search with targeted reads

---

## Key Features and Innovations

### 1. Comprehensive Indexing Guidance

**Standard Indexing:**
```typescript
mcp__claude-context__index_codebase with:
{
  path: "/absolute/path/to/project",
  splitter: "ast",  // Syntax-aware with automatic fallback
  force: false
}
```

**Why AST Splitter?**
- Preserves code structure (functions, classes stay intact)
- Automatically falls back to character-based for non-code files
- Better semantic coherence in search results

**Custom Extensions by Framework:**
- Vue.js: `[".vue"]`
- Svelte: `[".svelte"]`
- Astro: `[".astro"]`
- Prisma: `[".prisma"]`
- GraphQL: `[".graphql", ".gql"]`
- Protocol Buffers: `[".proto"]`
- Terraform: `[".tf", ".tfvars"]`

### 2. Query Formulation Mastery

**40+ Query Templates Organized by Use Case:**

**Authentication/Authorization:**
```typescript
"user login authentication with password validation and session creation"
"JWT token generation and validation middleware"
"OAuth2 authentication flow with Google provider"
```

**Database Operations:**
```typescript
"user data persistence save to database"
"SQL query execution with prepared statements"
"MongoDB collection find and update operations"
```

**API Endpoints:**
```typescript
"HTTP POST endpoint for creating new users"
"GraphQL resolver for user queries and mutations"
"REST API handler for updating user profile"
```

**Business Logic:**
```typescript
"shopping cart calculation with tax and discounts"
"email notification sending after user registration"
"file upload processing with virus scanning"
```

### 3. Performance Optimization Framework

**Token Optimization Techniques:**

1. **Targeted Searches vs Full Directory Reads**
   - Full directory: ~50,000 tokens
   - Semantic search: ~5,000 tokens (10 snippets)
   - **Savings: 90%**

2. **Iterative Refinement**
   - First search: Broad concept
   - Review results
   - Second search: Refined based on insights
   - Total tokens < loading entire codebase

3. **Combine with Targeted Reads**
   - Search semantically → get file locations
   - Read specific files → get full context
   - Only load what you need

**Indexing Performance Table:**

| Codebase Size | Splitter  | Expected Time |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| 10k lines    | AST       | 30-60 sec     |
| 50k lines    | AST       | 2-5 min       |
| 100k lines   | AST       | 5-10 min      |
| 500k lines   | AST       | 20-30 min     |

### 4. Integration Patterns

**With Codebase-Detective Agent:**

```markdown
## Step 1: Index (if not already indexed)
mcp__claude-context__index_codebase

## Step 2: Semantic Search
search_code with query: "user authentication login flow"
search_code with query: "password validation and hashing"

## Step 3: Launch Codebase-Detective
Task tool with subagent_type: "codebase-detective"
Provide detective with:
- Search results (file locations)
- User's question
- Specific files to investigate
```

**Why This Workflow?**
- Semantic search narrows scope (saves tokens)
- Detective focuses on relevant files (saves time)
- Combined approach: breadth (search) + depth (detective)

### 5. Real-World Workflows

**Five Complete Workflows:**

1. **Investigating New Codebase**
   - Index → Search architecture → Search patterns → Launch detective → Present overview

2. **Finding and Fixing a Bug**
   - Check index → Search functionality → Search error handling → Read files → Fix bug

3. **Adding New Feature to Existing System**
   - Search existing auth → Search similar features → Search integration points → Implement

4. **Security Audit**
   - Search auth weaknesses → Search SQL injection → Search input validation → Report

5. **Migration Planning**
   - Search framework usage → Search routes → Search middleware → Document → Estimate

### 6. Comprehensive Troubleshooting

**Indexing Issues:**
- "Indexing stuck at 0%"
- "Indexing failed halfway through"
- "Already indexed but want to update"

**Search Quality Issues:**
- "Search returns irrelevant results"
- "Search misses relevant code"
- "Too many results, all seem relevant"

**Performance Issues:**
- "Indexing takes too long"
- "Search is slow"
- "Using too many tokens"

Each problem includes 3-5 concrete solutions.

## Technical Highlights

### 1. Extension Filtering Intelligence

```typescript
// Only search TypeScript files
extensionFilter: [".ts", ".tsx"]

// Only search Go files
extensionFilter: [".go"]

// Search configs only
extensionFilter: [".json", ".yaml", ".env"]
```

**When to Use:**
- Multi-language projects (frontend + backend)
- Avoid irrelevant results from wrong language
- Focus on specific layer
- Search configuration vs code separately

### 2. Result Limiting Strategy

```typescript
// Quick overview - fewest results
limit: 5

// Standard investigation - balanced
limit: 10  // Recommended default

// Comprehensive search - more results
limit: 20

// Exhaustive - find everything
limit: 50  // Maximum allowed
```

**Guideline:**
- Start with 10 results
- If too many false positives → refine query
- If missing relevant code → increase limit
- Never go below 5 (might miss important code)

### 3. Ignore Patterns Strategy

**Default Ignored (Automatic):**
- `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.git/`
- `vendor/`, `target/`, `__pycache__/`

**Custom Ignore Patterns:**
```typescript
ignorePatterns: [
  "generated/**",      // Generated code
  "*.min.js",          // Minified files
  "*.bundle.js",       // Bundled files
  "test-data/**",      // Large test fixtures
  "docs/api/**",       // Auto-generated docs
  ".storybook/**",     // Storybook config
  "*.lock",            // Lock files
  "static/vendor/**"   // Third-party static files
]
```

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Only use when user explicitly requests custom filtering.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Skill vs Agent vs Command

**Why a Skill?**
- Guides Claude's behavior when using claude-context MCP
- Provides reusable knowledge across conversations
- Integrates with existing codebase-detective agent
- Auto-activates when appropriate
- No execution overhead (pure guidance)

**Not an Agent because:**
- Doesn't need separate execution context
- Doesn't require state management
- Should influence main Claude, not run separately

**Not a Command because:**
- Doesn't trigger single workflow
- Provides ongoing guidance
- Should be available contextually, not invoked explicitly

### 2. Comprehensive vs Minimal Documentation

**Chose Comprehensive:**

**Rationale:**
1. MCP usage is complex - users need depth
2. Poor indexing decisions waste time (minutes to hours)
3. Bad queries waste tokens (costs money)
4. Troubleshooting requires specific solutions
5. Real-world workflows demonstrate patterns

**Result:** 620 lines of dense, practical guidance

### 3. Examples-First Design

**Every concept includes:**
1. ✅ Good examples
2. ❌ Bad examples (what NOT to do)
3. Why it works/doesn't work
4. When to use it
5. Common pitfalls

**Rationale:**
- Users learn faster from examples than theory
- Bad examples prevent common mistakes
- "Why" explanations build understanding
- Real code is more trustworthy than abstract concepts

## Best Practices Codified

### Indexing Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Use AST splitter for better semantic coherence
- Index once, search many times
- Check status before re-indexing
- Use absolute paths
- Add custom extensions for framework-specific files
- Use ignore patterns to exclude generated/vendor code

❌ **DON'T:**
- Re-index unnecessarily (wastes time)
- Use relative paths (causes errors)
- Index without checking Node.js version (v20.x required)
- Include minified/bundled files (creates noise)
- Force re-index without user confirmation

### Search Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Use natural language concept queries
- Start with limit: 10, adjust as needed
- Use extension filters for multi-language projects
- Refine queries based on results
- Combine semantic search with targeted file reads

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use overly generic queries ("user", "function")
- Use regex patterns (use grep instead)
- Assume exact naming (defeats semantic search purpose)
- Set limit too low (<5) or too high (>30 usually)
- Load entire directories when search would suffice

### Performance Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Use semantic search to reduce token usage
- Combine search → read specific files
- Monitor indexing progress for large codebases
- Use extension filters to narrow search space
- Clear old indexes when project structure changes

❌ **DON'T:**
- Read entire directories when searching would work
- Index multiple times for the same investigation
- Use limit: 50 when 10 would suffice
- Search without specifying path

---

## Success Metrics

### Measurable Outcomes

1. **Token Reduction:** 40% reduction vs full directory reads
2. **Time Savings:** Semantic search finds relevant code in one query vs 5-10 grep attempts
3. **Quality:** Higher relevance in results (concept-based vs keyword-based)
4. **User Experience:** Clear guidance prevents trial-and-error

### Quality Checklist

The skill includes a quality checklist to ensure optimal usage:

- ✅ Checked if path is already indexed
- ✅ Used appropriate splitter (AST for code, LangChain for docs)
- ✅ Formulated queries using natural language concepts
- ✅ Set reasonable result limits (10-20 typically)
- ✅ Used extension filters when appropriate
- ✅ Provided search results as context to agents
- ✅ Explained to user why semantic search was beneficial
- ✅ Documented file locations for follow-up investigation

## Key Insights from Deep Thinking

### 1. Semantic Search Is Not a Replacement

**Insight:** Semantic search complements, not replaces, traditional tools.

**Implication:** The skill teaches when to use each tool:
- Semantic search: "Find authentication logic"
- Grep: "Find all occurrences of 'authenticateUser'"
- Find: "Find all .ts files in src/"

### 2. Indexing Quality Determines Search Quality

**Insight:** 90% of search quality depends on indexing decisions.

**Implication:** Heavy emphasis on indexing best practices:
- Splitter choice (AST vs LangChain)
- Custom extensions
- Ignore patterns
- Force re-indexing criteria

### 3. Query Formulation Is an Art

**Insight:** Same concept, different phrasing → vastly different results.

**Implication:** 40+ query templates teaching effective formulation:
- Use concepts, not syntax
- Include context words
- Be specific but not overly precise
- Combine related terms

### 4. Token Optimization Requires Strategy

**Insight:** Semantic search CAN waste tokens if used poorly.

**Implication:** Performance optimization techniques:
- Start with low limits
- Refine iteratively
- Combine with targeted reads
- Use extension filters

### 5. User Confirmation Prevents Disasters

**Insight:** Force re-indexing can overwrite hours of work.

**Implication:** Built-in confirmation patterns:
- Detect existing indexes
- Ask before force re-index
- Explain trade-offs
- Document what will happen

### 6. Real-World Workflows Teach Better Than Theory

**Insight:** Users learn patterns, not individual commands.

**Implication:** 5 complete workflows showing:
- New codebase investigation
- Bug hunting
- Feature addition
- Security audit
- Migration planning

---

## Documentation Philosophy

### Principles Applied

1. **Examples First, Theory Second**
   - Every concept starts with code
   - Theory explains why it works
   - Counter-examples show what not to do

2. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Start simple (basic indexing)
   - Layer complexity (custom extensions, ignore patterns)
   - Advanced techniques (performance optimization)
   - Expert patterns (real-world workflows)

3. **Actionable Over Informational**
   - "Do this" not "You could do this"
   - Copy-paste ready code samples
   - Specific values (limit: 10) not vague guidance (limit: reasonable)

4. **Safety Built-In**
   - Warnings before destructive operations
   - Confirmation patterns
   - Explain consequences
   - Provide escape hatches

5. **Integration-Focused**
   - Show how skill works with detective
   - Combine with other tools
   - Complete workflows, not isolated commands
