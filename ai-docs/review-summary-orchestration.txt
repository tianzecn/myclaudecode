ORCHESTRATION PLUGIN DESIGN REVIEW - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Generated: November 22, 2025
Reviewer: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini via OpenRouter

OVERALL ASSESSMENT: ✓ WELL-DESIGNED WITH CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED

Design Quality: 8/10 (comprehensive, logical, ambitious)
Readiness for Implementation: 5/10 (must fix CRITICAL issues first)
Risk Level: MEDIUM-HIGH (depends on pre-Phase-1 decisions)

===============================================================================
ISSUE SUMMARY
===============================================================================

CRITICAL (3 Issues - MUST FIX BEFORE PHASE 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Architecture Decision Needed (Skills-Only vs Hybrid)
   - Impact: High (limits future scalability)
   - Effort: Low (design decision only)
   - Timeline: Immediate decision needed

2. Skill Descriptions Lack Discovery Trigger Words
   - Impact: High (reduces adoption by ~60%)
   - Effort: Medium (4 skill descriptions × 2 hours each)
   - Timeline: Must complete before Phase 1 starts
   - Action: Add trigger keywords, USE WHEN sections, AVOIDS sections

3. Content Extraction Incomplete - Missing /implement Patterns
   - Impact: High (skills won't cover sophisticated workflows)
   - Effort: High (extract complex patterns like test-driven loop)
   - Timeline: Must complete before Phase 1 starts
   - Action: Extract PHASE 2.5 test-driven loop, design validation, agent capability matching

HIGH (3 Issues - MUST FIX DURING PHASE 1)
──────────────────────────────────────────
4. Missing Skill Dependency Documentation
   - Impact: High (wrong skill combinations, integration failures)
   - Effort: Low (2-3 hours documentation)
   - Timeline: Phase 1 completion
   - Action: Add SKILL DEPENDENCIES sections, create quick-start guide

5. Migration Path Lacks Risk Assessment
   - Impact: High (increases rollback time, unprepared for issues)
   - Effort: Medium (4-6 hours risk analysis + documentation)
   - Timeline: Phase 1 start
   - Action: Create risk matrix, rollback procedures, phase gates

6. Backward Compatibility Testing Plan Missing
   - Impact: Critical (could break existing workflows undetected)
   - Effort: High (comprehensive testing across all commands)
   - Timeline: Before Phase 2 (integration)
   - Action: Run compatibility matrix tests, verify all commands, test failure scenarios

MEDIUM (2 Issues - RECOMMENDED FIXES)
──────────────────────────────────────
7. Skill Granularity May Be Too Fine
   - Impact: Medium (higher learning curve, complex discovery)
   - Effort: Low (monitoring + quick-start guide)
   - Timeline: After v1.0 GA
   - Action: Monitor adoption, plan consolidation for v1.1 if needed

8. Async Patterns Not Covered (Long-Running Tasks, Cancellation)
   - Impact: Medium (real-world workflows will hit these)
   - Effort: High (new skill design)
   - Timeline: Plan for v1.1
   - Action: Document in design as "v1.1 enhancement", add placeholder

9. Pre-Release Testing Plan Undefined
   - Impact: Medium (higher post-release bug risk)
   - Effort: Medium (4 hours planning + checklist)
   - Timeline: Phase 1 completion
   - Action: Define alpha/beta/rc phases with timelines and exit criteria

LOW (1 Issue - NICE-TO-HAVE)
─────────────────────────────
10. Missing API Reference Documentation
    - Impact: Low (documentation completeness)
    - Effort: Low (2-3 hours documentation)
    - Timeline: Before GA release
    - Action: Add Appendix D with API reference, error messages

===============================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
===============================================================================

STRENGTHS
─────────
✓ Comprehensive extraction from proven commands (/review, /validate-ui, /implement)
✓ Logical skill separation (4 focused skills vs 1 monolithic)
✓ Context-efficient approach (load only needed skills)
✓ Well-documented integration patterns (3 complete workflow examples)
✓ Thoughtful backward compatibility strategy (keep critical inline)
✓ Realistic migration path (4 phases over 8 weeks)
✓ Clear success criteria and future enhancements

GAPS
────
✗ Missing trigger words for skill discovery (will users find skills?)
✗ Incomplete content extraction (test-driven loop, design validation not covered)
✗ No risk assessment for migration phases (what if Phase 2 breaks?)
✗ No backward compatibility testing plan (have we verified no breaks?)
✗ Architecture decision deferred (skills-only vs hybrid not decided)
✗ Async patterns not planned (long-running tasks not addressed)
✗ Pre-release testing plan missing (will GA release be stable?)

RISKS
─────
🔴 HIGH: Backward compatibility breaks in Phase 2 (users experience silent failures)
🔴 HIGH: Skills not discovered by Claude (low adoption despite good content)
🔴 HIGH: Incomplete skill content (test-driven loop pattern missing)
🟡 MEDIUM: Architecture doesn't scale (v1.1 workflow templates hit limits)
🟡 MEDIUM: Real-world workflows timeout (async patterns not planned for v1.0)

RECOMMENDATIONS
────────────────
BEFORE PHASE 1 (BLOCKING):
  1. Make architecture decision (hybrid vs skills-only)
  2. Enhance all skill descriptions with trigger words
  3. Complete content extraction (especially /implement patterns)

DURING PHASE 1:
  1. Document skill dependencies
  2. Create risk/rollback matrix
  3. Write 4 skills with complete content
  4. Create pre-release testing plan

BEFORE PHASE 2 (BLOCKING FOR INTEGRATION):
  1. Run backward compatibility tests
  2. Verify all commands working
  3. Get sign-off: "Backward compatibility verified"

AFTER PHASE 1:
  1. Monitor adoption metrics
  2. Plan async patterns for v1.1
  3. Plan skill consolidation if granularity causes friction

===============================================================================
CRITICAL PATH TO GA RELEASE
===============================================================================

Week 1-2:   Architecture decision + Skill descriptions + Content mapping
Week 3-4:   Phase 1: Create orchestration plugin (4 skills)
Week 5:     Backward compatibility testing (GATING)
Week 6:     Beta testing with community feedback
Week 7:     Release candidate testing
Week 8:     1.0.0 GA Release + Frontend v3.7.0 integration

ESTIMATED TIMELINE: 8 weeks
TARGET GA DATE: ~January 31, 2026
BUFFER: 2 weeks padding

GATES (If any blocked, timeline slips):
✓ Architecture decision (blocks Phase 1 design)
✓ Content extraction complete (blocks skill writing)
✓ Backward compatibility verified (blocks Phase 2)
✓ Community feedback incorporated (blocks GA)
