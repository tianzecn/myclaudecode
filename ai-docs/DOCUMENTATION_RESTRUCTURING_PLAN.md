# MAG Claude Plugins - Documentation Restructuring Plan

**Created:** 2025-11-11
**Author:** Claude Code Analysis
**Status:** Proposal - Awaiting Approval
**Estimated Effort:** 72-100 hours (40-60 with AI assistance)
**Timeline:** 7-8 weeks (phased implementation)

---

## Executive Summary

After analyzing all existing documentation (15+ files, ~6,000 lines), I've identified critical gaps and organizational issues that make the plugins harder to adopt than necessary. This plan proposes a complete documentation overhaul focused on **progressive disclosure** and **persona-based navigation**.

### Key Problems Identified:
- ❌ 534-line README with aggressive marketing that buries setup instructions
- ❌ Information scattered across 15+ files with no clear navigation
- ❌ Missing beginner tutorial (30-minute time to first success)
- ❌ No task-based guides or real-world examples
- ❌ Team setup docs hidden in `ai-docs/` instead of main `docs/`

### Proposed Solution:
- ✅ Rewrite README to 80 lines (clear, helpful, focused)
- ✅ Create 5-minute QUICK_START tutorial
- ✅ Build task-based guides directory
- ✅ Reorganize into persona-based navigation
- ✅ Add FAQ, examples, and consolidated reference docs

### Expected Impact:
- **Time to first success:** 30 min → 5 min (83% reduction)
- **Support questions:** 60% reduction
- **Plugin adoption:** Higher conversion (easier to start)
- **Team adoption:** Clear multi-developer setup
- **Contribution rate:** More external PRs

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### What Exists (Strengths to Preserve):

| Asset | Location | Lines | Quality | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|---------|-------|
| README.md | Root | 534 | Mixed | Good content, poor structure |
| CHANGELOG.md | Root | 829 | Excellent | Detailed version history |
| local-development.md | docs/ | 795 | Good | Contributor guide |
| frontend/README.md | plugins/ | 413 | Good | Plugin documentation |
| DEPENDENCIES.md | plugins/frontend/ | 549 | Excellent | Technical reference |
| troubleshooting.md | docs/ | 654 | Excellent | Solution-focused |
| TEAM_CONFIG_ARCHITECTURE.md | ai-docs/ | 601 | Excellent | Wrong location |
| DYNAMIC_MCP_GUIDE.md | ai-docs/ | - | Good | Wrong location |

**Total existing documentation:** ~6,000 lines across 15+ files

### Critical Issues Identified:

#### 1. **Overwhelming Entry Point**

**Problem:** README.md is 534 lines with aggressive marketing language
- Lines 1-64: Marketing pitch ("brutal truth", "stop wasting time")
- Lines 65-101: Quick start (buried)
- Lines 102-260: What's inside (too detailed too early)
- Lines 261-534: More details, examples, documentation links

**Impact:** Users see sales pitch instead of "how do I start?"

**Evidence:**
```markdown
## 🏆 Stop Wasting Time. Ship Like the Top 1%.

**While you're fighting with AI prompts, elite teams are shipping 3x faster.**

At tianzecn and 10xLabs, we don't do "good enough." We're the teams that Fortune 500 companies hire when their own developers can't deliver...
```

**What users need:** Clear value proposition + immediate "try this" command

---

#### 2. **Fragmented Information**

**Problem:** Environment setup documented in 4+ places
- README.md (partial)
- DEPENDENCIES.md (complete)
- plugins/frontend/README.md (partial)
- troubleshooting.md (error-focused)

**Impact:** Users don't know which guide to follow

**Example duplication:**
- Figma token setup: Explained 3 times differently
- MCP server configuration: 4 different explanations
- Plugin installation: 2 competing approaches

---

#### 3. **Missing User Journeys**

**Problem:** No progressive learning path

**What's missing:**
- ❌ 5-minute "try it now" tutorial
- ❌ Beginner walkthrough (your first feature)
- ❌ Intermediate guides (specific workflows)
- ❌ Advanced patterns (optimization, customization)
- ❌ Persona-based entry points (user vs team lead vs contributor)

**Current user experience:**
1. Land on README (overwhelmed by marketing)
2. Scroll to find installation (hidden)
3. Follow partial setup instructions
4. Get stuck on environment variables (which are required?)
5. Search through 3+ docs to find complete info
6. Give up or ask for support

**Desired user experience:**
1. Land on README (clear value proposition)
2. Click "5-Minute Quick Start"
3. Copy-paste 3 commands
4. Try first feature (success!)
5. Explore guides based on interest

---

#### 4. **Unclear Information Hierarchy**

**Problem:** docs/ directory has only 3 files
- docs/local-development.md (contributor guide)
- docs/troubleshooting.md (problem solving)
- docs/figma-integration-guide.md (specific feature)

**Where's the rest?**
- 9+ technical files in ai-docs/ (wrong audience)
- Plugin docs in plugins/*/README.md (not integrated)
- No central navigation hub

**Impact:** Users don't know where to look

---

#### 5. **Documentation Gaps**

| Gap | Impact | Priority | Effort |
|-----|--------|----------|--------|
| 5-minute quick start | High barrier to entry | CRITICAL | 2h |
| Getting started tutorial | Users give up early | CRITICAL | 4h |
| FAQ | Repeated support questions | CRITICAL | 2h |
| Plugin comparison guide | Wrong plugin selection | HIGH | 3h |
| Task-based guides | Abstract understanding only | HIGH | 12h |
| Real-world examples | No copy-paste starting points | HIGH | 8h |
| Glossary | Terminology confusion | MEDIUM | 2h |
| Migration guides | Upgrade friction | MEDIUM | 4h |
| Architecture diagrams | Mental model gaps | MEDIUM | 6h |
| Video tutorials | Visual learners excluded | LOW | 20h |
| Cheat sheet | Constant reference lookup | LOW | 2h |

**Total identified gaps:** ~65 hours of work

---

## 🎯 Target Audience Definition

### Primary Audiences (with distinct needs):

#### 1. **First-Time Users** (70% of visitors)

**Persona:** Sarah, Frontend Developer

- [ ] 5-minute quick start (absolute minimal setup)
- [ ] Clear prerequisites (what must I have?)
- [ ] Single command to try it
- [ ] "Success!" confirmation

**Current Pain Points:**
- Overwhelmed by 534-line README marketing
- Unclear where to start
- Don't know if setup is 5 minutes or 5 hours
- Can't tell if this solves their problem

**Proposed Solution:**
- New `QUICK_START.md` - 5-minute tutorial
- Simplified README intro (50 lines max)
- Clear "try this" command prominently displayed

**Success Metric:** 80% of first-time users reach "first success" in <10 minutes

---

- [ ] Onboarding checklist (new developer setup)
- [ ] Configuration management (shareable vs secrets)
- [ ] Troubleshooting decision trees
- [ ] Best practices for teams

**Current Pain Points:**
- TEAM_CONFIG_ARCHITECTURE.md exists but hidden in ai-docs/
- No onboarding checklist
- Unclear what to commit to git
- No team-specific troubleshooting

**Proposed Solution:**
- Move team docs to `docs/team/`
- Create onboarding checklist
- Add configuration decision tree

**Success Metric:** Teams onboard new developers in <10 minutes

---

#### 4. **Contributors** (Plugin developers)

**Persona:** Jordan, Open Source Developer

- [ ] Code contribution guide
- [ ] Testing and validation process
- [ ] Release process

**Current Pain Points:**
- local-development.md is good but mixed with marketplace development
- No architecture overview
- No contribution workflow
- Unclear testing requirements

**Proposed Solution:**
- Split into `docs/contributing/` directory
- Add architecture docs with diagrams
- Clear contribution workflow

**Success Metric:** Contributors set up local environment in <15 minutes

---

#### 5. **Maintainers** (Jack & future maintainers)

**Persona:** Jack + Future Maintainers
- Making architectural decisions
- Need rationale for past decisions
- Release and maintenance workflows

**Goal:** "How do we make decisions? What's the rationale?"

**Needs:**
- [ ] Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- [ ] Technical reference documentation
- [ ] Release process
- [ ] Design principles
- [ ] Historical context

**Current Pain Points:**
- Good content in ai-docs/ but not organized for handoff
- No ADR format
- No decision rationale documented
- Hard to find "why we did X"

**Proposed Solution:**
- Keep ai-docs/ but add structure
- Convert key docs to ADRs
- Add architecture diagrams
- Create release checklist

**Success Metric:** New maintainer understands architecture in 1 day

| **Claudish** | Testing different AI models | Access Grok, GPT-5, MiniMax, Qwen |

**[See Detailed Plugin Comparison](plugins/README.md)**

---

### Q: How do I install the plugins?

**A:** Two methods:

**Quick Method (Recommended):**
```bash
# 1. Add marketplace globally
/plugin marketplace add tianzecn/myclaudecode

# 2. Enable in .claude/settings.json
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "frontend@tianzecn-plugins": true
  }
}
```

**Team Method:**
- Commit `.claude/settings.json` to git
- Team members auto-install when they pull

**[Detailed Installation Guide](installation.md)**

---

### Q: Do I need to configure environment variables?

**A:** Only for optional features:

| Feature | Required Env Vars | When Needed |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Basic features | None | ✅ Works immediately |
| Figma import | `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Only for `/import-figma` |
| Apidog integration | `APIDOG_API_TOKEN`<br>`APIDOG_PROJECT_ID` | Only for `/api-docs` |
| Claudish (OpenRouter) | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Only for multi-model CLI |

**[See Environment Variables Guide](reference/environment-variables.md)**

---

### Q: What are the system requirements?

**A:** Minimal requirements:

- ✅ Claude Code installed
- ✅ Git access to GitHub
- ✅ Node.js 18+ (for MCP servers)
- ✅ Chrome browser (for UI testing - optional)

**[See Installation Guide](installation.md#prerequisites)**

---

### Q: Can I use this on Windows/Mac/Linux?

**A:** Yes! The plugins work on all platforms where Claude Code runs.

**Note:** Some MCP server paths may differ by OS.

---

## Usage

### Q: How do I implement a feature?

**A:** Use the `/implement` command:

```bash
/implement Create a UserProfile component with avatar and bio
```

**What happens:**
1. Architect plans the solution
2. Developer implements code
3. Test architect writes tests
4. Reviewer reviews code
5. Deliverly production-ready feature

**[See Complete Tutorial](guides/your-first-feature.md)**

---

### Q: What's the difference between /implement and /implement-ui?

**A:**

| Command | Purpose | Best For | Workflow |
|---------|---------|----------|----------|
| `/implement` | Full-cycle feature | Any feature (API/UI/Mixed) | 8 phases, intelligent detection |
| `/implement-ui` | UI-only | Pixel-perfect design work | Task decomposition, design validation |

**Key difference:** `/implement-ui` is specialized for matching exact designs (Figma).

**[See Command Reference](reference/commands.md)**

---

### Q: How do I import Figma designs?

**A:**

**Prerequisites:**
1. Set environment variable: `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN`
2. Get Figma file URL (from Figma Dev Mode)

**Usage:**
```bash
/import-figma NavigationBar
```

**Troubleshooting:**
- Make sure you have access to the Figma file
- Check Dev Mode is enabled in Figma
- Verify token has correct permissions

**[See Figma Integration Guide](guides/working-with-figma.md)**

---

### Q: How do I use semantic code search?

**A:**

**Install code-analysis plugin:**
```json
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "code-analysis@tianzecn-plugins": true
  }
}
```

**Use /analyze command:**
```bash
/analyze Find all authentication logic in the codebase
```

**Benefits:**
- 40% token reduction vs traditional search
- Understands code semantics (not just keywords)
- Cross-file relationship analysis

**[See Code Analysis Guide](plugins/code-analysis/overview.md)**

---

### Q: Can I use multiple plugins at once?

**A:** Yes! Enable multiple plugins in settings:

```json
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "frontend@tianzecn-plugins": true,
    "code-analysis@tianzecn-plugins": true,
    "bun@tianzecn-plugins": true
  }
}
```

**Common combinations:**
- Frontend + Code Analysis (UI development + codebase understanding)
- Frontend + Bun (full-stack development)
- All three (maximum capabilities)

**[See Multi-Plugin Example](../examples/multi-plugin/)**

---

## Troubleshooting

### Q: Plugin not loading?

**A:** Check these in order:

1. **Verify marketplace is added:**
   ```bash
   /plugin marketplace list
   ```
   If not listed: `/plugin marketplace add tianzecn/myclaudecode`

2. **Check settings format (must be object, not array):**
   ```json
   // ✅ CORRECT
   {
     "enabledPlugins": {
       "frontend@tianzecn-plugins": true
     }
   }

   // ❌ WRONG
   {
     "enabledPlugins": ["frontend@tianzecn-plugins"]
   }
   ```

3. **Reload plugin:**
   ```bash
   /plugin reload frontend@tianzecn-plugins
   ```

4. **Restart Claude Code**

**[See Detailed Troubleshooting](troubleshooting/)**

---

### Q: MCP server not working?

**A:** Check these in order:

1. **Verify environment variables:**
   ```bash
   echo $FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN
   echo $APIDOG_API_TOKEN
   ```

2. **Check Node.js version:**
   ```bash
   node --version  # Should be 18+
   ```

3. **Use configuration command:**
   ```bash
   /configure-mcp
   ```
   This checks your setup and guides you through fixes.

4. **Test MCP server manually:**
   ```bash
   npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-figma --help
   ```

**[See MCP Troubleshooting](troubleshooting/common-errors.md#mcp-servers)**

---

### Q: How do I update plugins?

**A:**

**Simple update (updates all):**
```bash
/plugin marketplace update tianzecn-plugins
```

**Manual update (specific plugin):**
```bash
/plugin remove frontend@tianzecn-plugins
/plugin install frontend@tianzecn-plugins
```

**Check current version:**
```bash
/plugin list
```

**[See Update Guide](troubleshooting/README.md#updating-plugins)**

---

### Q: Commands are slow or timing out?

**A:**

**Common causes:**
1. Large codebase (semantic search indexing)
2. Network issues (MCP server connections)
3. Multiple concurrent operations

**Solutions:**
1. **For semantic search:** First-time indexing is slow, subsequent searches are fast
2. **For network:** Check internet connection, try again
3. **For multiple operations:** Wait for one to complete before starting another

**[See Performance Guide](troubleshooting/performance.md)**

---

## Teams

### Q: How do we set this up for a team?

**A:**

**3-step team setup:**

1. **Team lead: Commit shareable config (NO secrets)**
   ```json
   // .claude/settings.json (commit to git)
   {
     "enabledPlugins": {
       "frontend@tianzecn-plugins": true
     },
     "env": {
       "APIDOG_PROJECT_ID": "your-project-id"  // Shareable
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Each developer: Set personal tokens (secrets)**
   ```bash
   # In .env or ~/.zshrc (NOT committed)
   export APIDOG_API_TOKEN="personal-token"
   export FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN="personal-token"
   ```

3. **New team members: Pull and set tokens**
   ```bash
   git pull  # Gets .claude/settings.json (plugins auto-install)
   # Set personal tokens (see step 2)
   ```

**[See Team Setup Guide](team/setup-guide.md)**

---

### Q: What should we commit to git?

**A:**

| File/Setting | Commit? | Why |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| `.claude/settings.json` | ✅ Yes | Shareable config (no secrets) |
| `.env.example` | ✅ Yes | Template for team |
| `.env` | ❌ No | Contains secrets |
| `.claude/settings.local.json` | ❌ No | Personal overrides |

**Commit:**
- Project IDs (Apidog, Figma file URLs)
- Plugin configuration
- Shared settings

**Don't commit:**
- API tokens
- Personal access tokens
- Passwords
- Any credentials

**[See Configuration Guide](team/configuration.md)**

---

### Q: How do we onboard new developers?

**A:**

**5-minute onboarding checklist:**

1. **Clone project:** `git clone <repo>` (includes `.claude/settings.json`)
2. **Copy env template:** `cp .env.example .env`
3. **Get personal tokens:**
   - Apidog: https://app.apidog.com/settings/tokens
   - Figma: https://www.figma.com/settings (Personal Access Tokens)
4. **Set tokens in .env:** Edit `.env` with personal tokens
5. **Verify setup:** `/plugin list` (should show plugins auto-installed)

**[See Onboarding Checklist](team/onboarding.md)**

---

### Q: Can team members use different tokens?

**A:** Yes! This is recommended.

**Benefits:**
- Each developer has their own credentials
- Easy to revoke individual access
- Audit trail (know who did what)
- No shared password issues

**Each developer sets their own:**
```bash
export APIDOG_API_TOKEN="their-personal-token"
export FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN="their-personal-token"
```

**[See Team Best Practices](team/best-practices.md)**

---

## Advanced

### Q: Can I use custom AI models?

**A:** Yes! Use the **Claudish** CLI tool:

```bash
# Interactive model selector
claudish "implement user authentication"

# Specific model
claudish --model x-ai/grok-code-fast-1 "add tests"

# Other models
claudish --model openai/gpt-5-codex "your task"
claudish --model minimax/minimax-m2 "your task"
```

**Top recommended models:**
- `x-ai/grok-code-fast-1` - Fast coding
- `openai/gpt-5-codex` - Advanced reasoning
- `minimax/minimax-m2` - High performance

**[See Claudish Guide](plugins/claudish/overview.md)**

---

### Q: How do I create my own plugin?

**A:**

**Quick steps:**
1. Clone the repository
2. Create plugin directory: `plugins/my-plugin/`
3. Create `plugin.json` manifest
4. Add agents, commands, skills
5. Test locally
6. Submit PR

**[See Plugin Development Guide](contributing/creating-plugins.md)**

---

### Q: Can I customize existing agents?

**A:** Yes, two ways:

**Method 1: Fork and modify**
1. Fork the repository
2. Edit agent markdown files in `plugins/*/agents/`
3. Use local marketplace: `/plugin marketplace add /path/to/fork`

**Method 2: Create custom agent**
1. Create new agent in your project `.claude/agents/`
2. Extend existing plugin agents

**[See Development Guide](contributing/development-setup.md)**

---

### Q: How do I contribute?

**A:**

**Quick contribution guide:**

1. **Fork repository:** https://github.com/tianzecn/myclaudecode

3. **Create branch:** `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
4. **Make changes:** Edit files
5. **Test locally:** Use local marketplace
6. **Submit PR:** Push and create pull request

**[See Contributing Guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md)**

---

### Q: What's the plugin architecture?

**A:**

**High-level architecture:**
- **Plugins** contain agents, commands, skills, MCP servers
- **Agents** are specialized AI assistants (markdown files)
- **Commands** are slash commands (markdown workflows)
- **Skills** provide domain knowledge (markdown + files)
- **MCP Servers** integrate external tools (Figma, Apidog, etc.)

**[See Architecture Overview](../ai-docs/architecture/overview.md)**

---

### Q: Can I use this in CI/CD?

**A:** Yes, with limitations:

**What works:**
- Claudish CLI in CI/CD pipelines
- Automated code analysis
- Pre-commit hooks with agents

**What doesn't work:**
- Interactive commands (requires user input)
- Browser-based UI testing (needs display)

**Example CI usage:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/code-review.yml
- name: AI Code Review
  run: claudish --model x-ai/grok-code-fast-1 "Review changes for security issues"
```

## 🎨 Content Guidelines

### Writing Principles:

#### 1. **Progressive Disclosure**

**Principle:** Start simple, add complexity gradually

**Good Example:**
```markdown
## Quick Start

```bash
/implement Create a Button component
```

That's it! Claude will handle the rest.

**Want to customize?** [See Advanced Configuration](advanced.md)
```

**Bad Example:**
```markdown
## Quick Start

The /implement command accepts these parameters:
- --workflow (api|ui|mixed)
- --skip-review (boolean)
- --test-coverage (number 0-100)
...
```

**Why:** Don't overwhelm beginners with options. Show the simplest path first.

---

#### 2. **Task-Based Organization**

**Principle:** Organize by "how to do X" not "what is X"

**Good Example:**
```markdown
## How to Implement a Feature

1. Use /implement command
2. Review architecture plan
3. Approve implementation
...
```

**Bad Example:**
```markdown
## The Implement Command

The implement command is a slash command that invokes multiple agents in sequence...
```

**Why:** Users want to accomplish tasks, not understand architecture (unless they're contributors).

---

#### 3. **Clear Navigation Paths**

**Principle:** Every doc needs "where am I?" and "where do I go?"

**Required elements:**
- **Breadcrumbs:** `Home > Guides > UI Development`
- **Prerequisites:** What you need before starting
- **Next steps:** Where to go after this

**Example:**
```markdown
# UI Development Guide

> **Prerequisites:** [5-Minute Quick Start](quick-start.md) completed

## Next Steps

- [API Development Guide](api-development.md) - Integrate APIs
- [Working with Figma](working-with-figma.md) - Import designs
- [Testing Strategies](testing-strategies.md) - Test your UIs
```

---

#### 4. **Consistent Document Structure**

**Template for all guides:**

```markdown

#### 5. **Tone Adjustments**

**Current tone issues:**
- ❌ Aggressive: "While you're fighting with AI prompts..."
- ❌ Boastful: "We don't do 'good enough.'"
- ❌ Exclusive: "This is how the top 1% builds..."

**Desired tone:**
- ✅ Helpful: "These plugins help you ship faster"
- ✅ Professional: "Battle-tested in production"
- ✅ Inclusive: "Whether you're building your first feature or your hundredth..."

**Examples:**

**Before:**
```markdown
**While you're fighting with AI prompts, elite teams are shipping 3x faster.**

At tianzecn, we don't do "good enough." We're the teams Fortune 500 companies hire when their own developers can't deliver.
```

**After:**
```markdown
**Professional Claude Code plugins that help teams ship faster.**

Developed by tianzecn, these plugins are battle-tested in production environments handling millions of users.
```

**Why:** Focus on helping users succeed, not making them feel bad about current approach.

---

#### 6. **Code Example Standards**

**Always include:**
1. **Language tag:** \`\`\`bash, \`\`\`json, \`\`\`typescript
2. **Comments:** Explain non-obvious code
3. **Expected output:** Show what success looks like
4. **Context:** Explain when to use this example

**Example:**

```markdown
Create `.claude/settings.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  // Enable the frontend plugin
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "frontend@tianzecn-plugins": true
  }
}
```

Save the file. Claude Code will automatically install the plugin.

**Verify it worked:**
```bash
/plugin list
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ frontend@tianzecn-plugins
   Version: 2.9.0
   Status: Loaded
```
```

---

#### 7. **Visual Hierarchy**

**Use formatting consistently:**

```markdown
# H1 - Page title (one per page)

## H2 - Major sections

### H3 - Subsections

#### H4 - Minor subsections (use sparingly)

**Bold** - Important terms, emphasis
*Italic* - Secondary emphasis (use sparingly)
`code` - Inline code, commands, file names
> Blockquote - Important notes, warnings

- Unordered list
1. Ordered list (for sequences)
- [ ] Checklist (for prerequisites, steps)

| Table | For | Comparisons |
|-------|-----|-------------|

```bash
# Code blocks for commands

---

## 🎯 Key Decisions Needed

### 1. Documentation Site vs GitHub Markdown

**Question:** Should we use a documentation site (VitePress/Docusaurus) or stick with GitHub markdown?

**Options:**

| Option | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|--------|------|------|----------------|
| **GitHub Markdown** | - No build step<br>- Works immediately<br>- Easy to maintain<br>- Good for small projects | - No search<br>- Basic navigation<br>- Limited features | ✅ **Start here** |
| **VitePress** | - Beautiful UI<br>- Built-in search<br>- Fast (Vite-powered)<br>- Vue ecosystem | - Build step<br>- Deployment needed<br>- More complex | ⏳ **Migrate in Phase 7** |
| **Docusaurus** | - Feature-rich<br>- Good for large docs<br>- React ecosystem<br>- Versioning | - Heavier<br>- Longer setup<br>- More maintenance | ❌ **Overkill** |

**Recommendation:**
1. **Phase 1-6:** Use GitHub markdown (immediate, no complexity)
2. **Phase 7:** Evaluate need for doc site based on:
   - Documentation size
   - Search requirements
   - User feedback

**Rationale:** Get content right first, presentation second

---

### 2. Examples Location

**Question:** Should examples be in a separate repository or `examples/` directory in main repo?

**Options:**

| Option | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|--------|------|------|----------------|
| **examples/ directory** | - Single source of truth<br>- Easy to sync with code<br>- Simpler maintenance | - Larger repo size<br>- Mixed concerns | ✅ **Recommended** |
| **Separate repo** | - Cleaner main repo<br>- Can be more complex<br>- Easier to fork | - Sync issues<br>- More maintenance<br>- Fragmented docs | ❌ **Not recommended** |

**Recommendation:** Use `examples/` directory

**Rationale:**
- Examples need to stay in sync with plugin code
- Single source of truth
- Easier for users to find

---

### 3. Marketing Content

**Question:** What to do with the aggressive marketing language?

**Options:**

| Option | Description | Recommendation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Delete** | Remove completely | ❌ Loses value proposition |
| **Separate file (ABOUT.md)** | Move to dedicated file | ✅ **Recommended** |
| **Website** | Move to separate website | ⏳ Future consideration |
| **Keep in README** | Leave as-is | ❌ Blocks user onboarding |

**Recommendation:** Create `ABOUT.md` for the story

**Structure:**
- **README.md:** What it is, how to use it (80 lines)
- **ABOUT.md:** Our story, production metrics, case studies (500 lines)
- **Link from README:** "Read our story" link

**Rationale:**
- Separate marketing from getting-started
- Preserve value proposition for those interested
- Clear user journeys (doers vs learners)

---

### 4. Video Tutorials

**Question:** Should we create video tutorials?

**Options:**

| Option | Effort | Impact | Recommendation |
|--------|--------|--------|----------------|
| **No videos** | 0h | Medium | ✅ **Phase 1-6** |
| **Screen recordings** | 4-8h | High | ⏳ **Phase 7** |
| **Professional videos** | 20-40h | Very High | ❌ **Too expensive** |

**Recommendation:** Start without videos, add in Phase 7 if needed

**Rationale:**
- Written docs are higher priority
- Videos require maintenance (get outdated)
- Can always add later based on user feedback

**If we add videos (Phase 7):**
1. **Quick Start** (5 min) - Installation to first feature
2. **Feature Implementation** (10 min) - Complete workflow
3. **Team Setup** (8 min) - Multi-developer configuration

---

### 5. Glossary Depth

**Question:** How comprehensive should the glossary be?

**Options:**

| Depth | Terms | Effort | Recommendation |
|-------|-------|--------|----------------|
| **Basic** | 20-30 terms | 1-2h | ✅ **Phase 7** |
| **Comprehensive** | 50-100 terms | 4-6h | ❌ **Overkill** |
| **None** | 0 terms | 0h | ❌ **Users confused** |

**Recommendation:** Basic glossary (20-30 core terms)

**Include:**
- Plugin, Agent, Command, Skill, MCP Server
- Workflow types (API/UI/Mixed)
- Key technologies (Claude Code, TanStack, Bun)
- Processes (Semantic search, Design validation)

**Rationale:** Define core concepts, link to detailed docs for more
