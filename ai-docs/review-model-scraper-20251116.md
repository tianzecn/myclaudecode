## Positive Highlights

-   **Exceptional Detail and Clarity**: The agent's definition, instructions, and knowledge sections are remarkably thorough, providing explicit guidance on every aspect of its operation, including complex JavaScript snippets and error handling.
-   **Robust MCP-Only Approach Enforcement**: The `<Bash Tool Usage Restrictions>` and `<approach_requirement>` are very clear in enforcing the exclusive use of Chrome DevTools MCP, preventing insecure or unintended network requests.
-   **Outstanding Example Quality**: The 5 provided examples are highly concrete, actionable, cover diverse scenarios (success, partial failure, critical failure), and clearly differentiate between correct and wrong approaches.
-   **Comprehensive TodoWrite Integration**: TodoWrite is seamlessly integrated into the workflow and explicitly detailed in the critical constraints, ensuring clear progress tracking.
-   **Advanced Tiered Pricing Handling**: The detailed strategy for detecting and correctly handling tiered pricing for models is a critical and well-thought-out feature, demonstrating deep understanding of the scraping target.
-   **Effective Error Handling Strategies**: A dedicated `<error_handling>` section outlines clear strategies for various failure modes, enhancing agent resilience.
-   **Well-Structured XML**: The XML structure is clean, logical, and fully compliant with expected standards.
