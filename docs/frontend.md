## The `/implement` Command: Full-Cycle Orchestration

The `/implement` command is the cornerstone of this plugin. It orchestrates a complete feature development workflow from planning to delivery, ensuring quality at every step.

### What Makes `/implement` Special

`/implement` is not just a code generator—it's a complete development workflow that:

1. **Plans before coding** - Architecture-first approach with user approval gates
2. **Implements with quality** - Following project patterns and best practices
3. **Reviews thoroughly** - Triple review process (human + AI + browser testing)
4. **Tests comprehensively** - Automated test generation with Vitest
5. **Cleans automatically** - Removes temporary artifacts

### The Complete `/implement` Workflow

```bash
/implement Create a user profile page with avatar upload, bio editing, and settings panel
```

This single command triggers an 8-phase orchestration (with optional Phase 2.5 for design validation):

#### Phase 1: Architecture Planning

**Agent:** `architect`

**What happens:**
1. **Gap Analysis**
   - Scans existing codebase patterns
   - Identifies reusable components
   - Finds similar implementations
   - Reviews project architecture

2. **Clarification Questions**
   - Asks about specific requirements
   - Confirms technical decisions
   - Validates assumptions
   - Gathers constraints

3. **Architecture Design**
   - Designs component hierarchy
   - Plans state management approach
   - Defines API integration strategy
   - Considers accessibility and performance

4. **Documentation**
   - Creates detailed plan in `AI-DOCS/`
   - Documents component structure
   - Lists implementation steps
   - Includes code examples

5. **User Approval Gate** ⛔
   - Presents plan for review
   - Explains architectural decisions
   - Waits for explicit approval
   - **No code written until approved**

**Example Output:**
```
Architecture Plan: User Profile Feature
────────────────────────────────────────
Components:
  - ProfilePage (container)
  - ProfileHeader (avatar + basic info)
  - AvatarUpload (drag-drop + preview)
  - BioEditor (rich text editing)
  - SettingsPanel (preferences form)

State Management:
  - TanStack Query for user data
  - Local state for form inputs
  - Optimistic updates for bio changes

API Integration:
  - GET /users/:id
  - PATCH /users/:id/profile
  - POST /users/:id/avatar

Plan saved to: AI-DOCS/user-profile-feature.md

👤 Review the plan and type 'approved' to proceed
```

---

#### Stage 2: Implementation

**Agent:** `developer`

**What happens:**
1. **Todo List Creation**
   - Breaks plan into specific tasks
   - Creates visible progress tracker
   - User can see exactly what's being built

2. **Code Generation**
   - Follows project patterns (file structure, naming conventions)
   - Uses existing components and utilities
   - Implements TypeScript types correctly
   - Follows React best practices
   - Integrates with TanStack Router and Query

3. **Quality Checks (Automated)**
   - Runs Biome linter/formatter
   - Validates TypeScript compilation
   - Checks for common mistakes
   - Ensures code style consistency

4. **Progress Updates**
   - Marks todos as completed in real-time
   - Shows what's being worked on
   - Reports any issues immediately

**Example Output:**
```
Implementation Progress
────────────────────────────────────────
✅ Create ProfilePage container component
✅ Implement AvatarUpload with preview
✅ Add BioEditor with form validation
✅ Build SettingsPanel with preferences
✅ Integrate TanStack Query hooks
✅ Add route configuration
⏳ Running quality checks...
✅ Biome: No issues found
✅ TypeScript: Compilation successful
✅ All checks passed!

Implementation complete. Ready for review.
```

#### Stage 2.5: Design Fidelity Validation (Optional, Conditional)

**Agents:** `designer`, `css-developer`

**When it runs:**
- Automatically triggered if Figma URLs are present in the feature request
- Skipped if no design references found (no performance impact)
- Can be run manually via `/validate-ui` command

**What happens:**
1. **Screenshot & DOM Inspection**
   - Captures current implementation in browser
   - Inspects DOM elements via Chrome DevTools MCP
   - Gets computed CSS properties (actual rendered values)
   - Identifies which CSS rules and Tailwind classes apply

2. **CSS Developer Consultation**
   - Understands existing CSS patterns
   - Identifies standard component styles
   - Assesses impact of potential changes (LOCAL vs GLOBAL)
   - Provides safe fix recommendations

3. **Design Comparison with CSS Awareness**
   - Compares design reference vs implementation
   - Shows expected vs actual computed CSS values
   - Identifies which classes cause discrepancies
   - Categorizes issues by severity (CRITICAL/MEDIUM/LOW)

4. **Iterative Validation**
   - UI Developer implements fixes
   - Designer validates changes
   - Maximum 3 iterations per component
   - Design fidelity score (X/60) must be >= 54 to pass

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No more guessing why UI looks different
- ✅ Understand which CSS rules cause visual differences
- ✅ Safe fixes that won't break other components
- ✅ Pattern-aware changes aligned with codebase
- ✅ Prevents breaking 26 other components while fixing 1

**Example Output:**
```
Design Fidelity Validation
────────────────────────────────────────
🖥️  Computed CSS Analysis:
Button (.btn-primary):
- padding: 8px 16px (from classes: px-4 py-2)
- background: #60A5FA (from class: bg-blue-400)

🧩 CSS Developer Insights:
- Standard button uses bg-blue-600 (26 files)
- This deviates from standard pattern

⚠️  Discrepancies Found (2 CRITICAL):
1. Button background color
   Expected: #3B82F6 (blue-600)
   Actual: #60A5FA (blue-400)
   Impact: LOCAL - Only this component
   Safe Fix: Change bg-blue-400 to bg-blue-600

Design Fidelity Score: 52/60 (FAIL - needs fixes)
```

## Best Practices

### When to Use `/implement`
✅ **Good for:**
- New features with clear requirements
- Features requiring multiple components
- Projects with established patterns
- When you want comprehensive quality checks

❌ **Not ideal for:**
- Quick bug fixes (use agents directly)
- Experimental prototypes
- Simple one-file changes

### Maximizing Quality
1. **Provide clear descriptions** - Detailed requirements = better architecture
2. **Review the plan** - Catch issues before implementation
3. **Check review reports** - Learn from suggestions
4. **Run tests** - Ensure nothing breaks

### Team Workflow
1. **Use project-specific installation** - Consistent setup
2. **Commit `.claude/settings.json`** - Share configuration
3. **Keep `.env` private** - Never commit secrets
4. **Share AI-DOCS** - Team knowledge base

---

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Servers Not Working
```bash
# Check if configured
/configure-mcp apidog

# Validate connection
/configure-mcp apidog
# Choose option [3] Test again
```

### Browser Testing Fails
```bash
# Set Chrome path in .env
CHROME_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/path/to/chrome
```

### Tests Not Generating
Ensure Vitest is installed:
```bash
npm install -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
```
