## [3.4.1] - 2025-11-13

### Fixed

#### Claudish Proxy Mode - Agent Configuration Inheritance

**CRITICAL FIX**: External AI models now invoke agents with full configuration when using Claudish proxy mode.

**Problem:**
- When agents used `claudish` in PROXY_MODE to call external LLMs (Grok, GPT-5, etc.), they were sending raw prompts
- External models didn't have access to agent configuration (tools, skills, instructions)
- This led to inconsistent behavior and missing context

**Solution:**
- Updated all 8 agents to use agent invocation pattern via Task tool
- Claudish inherits current directory's `.claude` configuration, so all agents are available
- External models now invoke the specific agent (e.g., "Use Task tool to launch 'plan-reviewer'")
- Ensures full agent configuration (tools, skills, instructions) is available to external models

**Files Updated:**
- `plugins/frontend/agents/plan-reviewer.md`
- `plugins/frontend/agents/designer.md`
- `plugins/frontend/agents/architect.md`
- `plugins/frontend/agents/css-developer.md`
- `plugins/frontend/agents/developer.md`
- `plugins/frontend/agents/reviewer.md`
- `plugins/frontend/agents/test-architect.md`
- `plugins/frontend/agents/ui-developer.md`

**Example Change:**
```bash
# Before (raw prompt)
PROMPT="You are an expert architect. Review this plan..."
printf '%s' "$PROMPT" | npx claudish --stdin --model x-ai/grok-code-fast-1 --quiet

# After (agent invocation)
AGENT_PROMPT="Use the Task tool to launch the 'architect' agent with this task:
Review the architecture plan..."
printf '%s' "$AGENT_PROMPT" | npx claudish --stdin --model x-ai/grok-code-fast-1 --quiet
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Consistent behavior across Sonnet and external models
- ✅ Full agent context (tools: Read, Write, Bash; skills; instructions)
- ✅ Maintainability - agent changes automatically picked up by external models
- ✅ Simplified approach - no special flags needed

## [3.4.0] - 2025-11-13

### Added

#### PHASE 1.6: External Code Reviewer Selection

**NEW**: User-controlled configuration of external AI code reviewers during planning phase.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Interactive selection** - Ask user which external AI models to use for code review in PHASE 3
- ✅ **Multi-model options** - Choose from Grok Code Fast (xAI), GPT-5 Codex (OpenAI), MiniMax M2, Qwen Vision-Language (Alibaba)
- ✅ **User control** - Explicit choice replaces hidden config file settings
- ✅ **Clear model attribution** - Results show friendly names (e.g., "Grok Code Fast (xAI)")
- ✅ **Optional workflow** - Can skip external reviewers (Claude Sonnet only)

**Workflow Integration:**
1. **PHASE 1**: Architecture planning
2. **PHASE 1.5**: Multi-model plan review (optional)
3. **PHASE 1.6 (NEW)**: Configure external code reviewers for PHASE 3
4. **PHASE 2**: Implementation
5. **PHASE 3**: Code review with user-selected models

**Model Mappings:**
- Grok Code Fast (xAI) → `x-ai/grok-code-fast-1`
- GPT-5 Codex (OpenAI) → `openai/gpt-5-codex`
- MiniMax M2 → `minimax/minimax-m2`
- Qwen Vision-Language (Alibaba) → `qwen/qwen3-vl-235b-a22b-instruct`

### Fixed

#### Code Review Agent Confusion
- **CRITICAL FIX**: PHASE 3 code review now uses `frontend:reviewer` agent (not `frontend:plan-reviewer`)
  - `frontend:plan-reviewer` is for reviewing architecture **plans** (PHASE 1.5)
  - `frontend:reviewer` is for reviewing implementation **code** (PHASE 3)
  - Added explicit documentation to prevent future confusion
- **Model naming clarity**: Fixed "Codex (GPT-4o)" confusion with correct model IDs
  - Display names now match actual OpenRouter models
  - No more contradictory naming (e.g., "External Codex" with GPT-4o model)

#### Token Optimization (98% reduction)
- **CRITICAL PERFORMANCE FIX**: Refactored orchestration to use file-based data exchange
  - Orchestrator now passes file paths instead of reading large files into context
  - Agents read input files themselves, write detailed work to output files
  - Agents return brief status messages (~500 tokens vs ~25k tokens)
  - **Result**: Orchestrator context reduced from ~287k to ~5.2k tokens (98.2% reduction)
- **Terminal output reduction**: Planning phase output reduced from 4,150 lines to ~110 lines (97.3% reduction)
- **Organized artifacts**: All detailed planning work now saved in `AI-DOCS/` folder
  - `implementation-plan.md` - Comprehensive architecture plan
  - `quick-reference.md` - Quick checklist
  - `{model-id}-review.md` - External review files
  - `review-consolidated.md` - Merged review findings

**Updated Files:**
- `plugins/frontend/agents/architect.md` (+162 lines: Communication Protocol)
- `plugins/frontend/agents/plan-reviewer.md` (+283 lines: File-based review + consolidation)
- `plugins/frontend/commands/implement.md` (Multiple phases updated with file-based orchestration)

**Benefits:**
- 🚀 **98% faster planning** - Minimal orchestrator token overhead
- 📁 **Better organization** - All planning artifacts in versioned files
- 💰 **Lower costs** - Fewer tokens = lower API costs
- 🔍 **Easy reference** - Detailed work easily found in AI-DOCS/ folder

### Changed

- **PHASE 1.6 added to global TODO list** - Ensures tracking of external reviewer configuration
- **Orchestration pattern** - Shifted from "orchestrator as processor" to "orchestrator as router"
- **Agent communication** - Standardized return format templates for brief status messages

## [3.3.1] - 2025-11-13

### Fixed

#### Multi-Model Plan Review Integration
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Multi-model plan review now proactively offered during PHASE 1 approval
  - Added "Get AI review first (recommended)" as built-in option alongside "Yes, proceed" and "No, I have feedback"
  - Previously required users to manually request review via text input
- **Efficiency improvement**: Pass file paths instead of embedding full plan content in prompts
  - Massive token savings (1000+ lines not duplicated)
  - Reviewers read files themselves using Read tool
  - Faster execution, cleaner prompts
- **plan-reviewer agent**: Fixed Claudish CLI integration
  - Correct syntax: `printf '%s' "$PROMPT" | npx claudish --stdin --model X --quiet`
  - Only checks `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (Claudish sets `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` automatically)
  - Added environment variable validation with clear setup instructions
  - Complete working example with error handling

#### Claudish CLI Fixes (v1.3.1)
- **BUG FIX**: `--stdin` mode no longer triggers interactive Ink UI
  - Fixed condition: `(!config.claudeArgs || config.claudeArgs.length === 0) && !config.stdin`
  - Resolves "Raw mode is not supported" errors when piping input
- **BUG FIX**: Removed premature `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` validation
  - Let `claude-runner.ts` set automatic placeholder (line 138)
  - Users only need to set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (single-variable setup)
  - Cleaner UX, no confusing placeholder concept for users
- **Cleanup**: Removed unused `@types/react` dependency (Ink already replaced with readline)

### Changed
- **Environment setup**: `.env.example` no longer includes `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` comment section
  - Reduced clutter - users only need `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
  - Claudish handles placeholder automatically

## [3.3.0] - 2025-11-13

### Added

#### Multi-Model Plan Review (PHASE 1.5)

**NEW**: Get independent perspectives from external AI models on architecture plans before implementation begins. Catch architectural issues, missing considerations, and edge cases early when changes are cheap.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Optional user-controlled workflow** - Ask user after plan approval, before implementation
- ✅ **Multi-model selection** - Choose from Grok, GPT-5 Codex, MiniMax M2, Qwen Vision-Language (or custom OpenRouter models)
- ✅ **Parallel execution** - All selected models review simultaneously for efficiency
- ✅ **Cross-model consensus** - Highlights issues flagged by multiple models (high confidence)
- ✅ **Consolidated feedback** - Synthesizes findings with severity levels (Critical/Medium/Low)
- ✅ **Plan revision loop** - Option to revise architecture plan based on feedback
- ✅ **Graceful degradation** - Handles missing API keys, model failures, user opt-out

**Workflow Integration** (in `/implement` command):
1. **PHASE 1**: Architect creates plan → User approves
2. **PHASE 1.5 (NEW)**:
   - Ask user: "Want multi-model plan review?"
   - If yes: User selects AI models (multi-select)
   - Launch plan-reviewer agents in parallel (one per model)
   - Consolidate feedback with cross-model consensus
   - Present synthesized report to user
   - User decides: Revise plan OR proceed as-is
3. **PHASE 2**: Implementation begins

**New Agent:**
- `plan-reviewer` - Specialized agent for reviewing architecture plans via external AI models
  - Supports PROXY_MODE for delegation to OpenRouter models
  - Evaluates: Architectural issues, missing considerations, alternative approaches, technology choices, implementation risks
  - Output format: APPROVED ✅ | NEEDS REVISION ⚠️ | MAJOR CONCERNS ❌

**Benefits:**
- 🎯 **Early issue detection** - Fix architectural problems before writing code
- 🤝 **Multi-model wisdom** - Different AI models bring different perspectives
- 📊 **Consensus validation** - Issues flagged by multiple models = high confidence
- 💰 **Cost effective** - Reviewing plans is cheaper than refactoring code
- 🔒 **User control** - Fully optional, user chooses models and whether to revise

**Configuration Support** (future enhancement):
```json
{
  "pluginSettings": {
    "frontend": {
      "planReviewModels": ["x-ai/grok-code-fast-1", "openai/gpt-5-codex"],
      "autoEnablePlanReview": false
    }
  }
}
```

**Updated Files:**
- `plugins/frontend/agents/plan-reviewer.md` (NEW)
- `plugins/frontend/commands/implement.md` (added PHASE 1.5)

## [3.1.1] - 2025-11-11

### Changed

#### Documentation Improvements

**Clarified Claudish CLI usage across all agents and commands:**
- Updated PROXY_MODE instructions in 7 agents with accurate Claudish CLI defaults
- Added clear distinctions between interactive and single-shot modes
- Updated commands and documentation files for consistency

**Claudish CLI Modes:**
- **Interactive mode** (default): `claudish` - Shows model selector, persistent session
- **Single-shot mode** (automation): `npx claudish --model <model> --stdin --quiet` - One task, exits

**Files Updated:**
- Agents: reviewer, developer, architect, designer, css-developer, ui-developer, test-architect
- Commands: implement.md
- Documentation: DEPENDENCIES.md, mcp-servers/README.md

**Companion Release:** Claudish v1.1.2 (interactive mode by default + async buffered logging performance fix)

**No functional changes** - this is purely documentation clarity for better user experience.

---

## [3.1.0] - 2025-11-11

### Changed

#### Major Architectural Improvement: MCP to CLI Migration

**Problem**: Claudish MCP server added unnecessary complexity requiring MCP configuration, server management, and additional tooling. Large prompts (like git diffs for code review) were difficult to pass through MCP tool calls.

**Solution**: Replace MCP server with direct CLI execution via Bash tool using stdin for large prompts.

#### Claudish CLI Enhancement

**Added stdin support (`--stdin` flag):**
- Implemented `readStdin()` function to handle piped input
- Updated CLI argument parser with `--stdin` flag
- Added comprehensive help documentation with stdin examples
- Enables: `echo "$PROMPT" | npx claudish --stdin --model x-ai/grok-code-fast-1 --quiet`

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No size limits for prompts (handles large git diffs)
- ✅ Standard Unix piping patterns
- ✅ Better integration with shell scripts
- ✅ Cleaner architecture

#### Agent Updates (7 agents migrated to CLI approach)

**Updated agents:**
- `reviewer.md` - Senior code reviewer
- `developer.md` - TypeScript frontend developer
- `architect.md` - Frontend architecture planner
- `designer.md` - UI/UX design reviewer
- `css-developer.md` - CSS architecture specialist
- `ui-developer.md` - Senior UI developer
- `test-architect.md` - Test strategy and implementation

**PROXY_MODE Pattern Changes:**
- **Before**: Used `mcp__claudish__call_external_ai` MCP tool
- **After**: Uses Bash tool with `npx claudish --stdin --model {model} --quiet`
- **Maintained**: Same PROXY_MODE directive detection and delegation logic
- **Improved**: Better handling of large prompts via stdin

**Example PROXY_MODE workflow:**
```markdown
1. Agent detects: PROXY_MODE: x-ai/grok-code-fast-1
2. Prepares full prompt (system context + task)
3. Executes: echo "$PROMPT" | npx claudish --stdin --model x-ai/grok-code-fast-1 --quiet
4. Returns external AI response with attribution
5. Done - no local execution
```

#### Command Updates

**/implement command:**
- Updated multi-model code review from "Claudish MCP" to "Claudish CLI"
- Changed setup verification from MCP server to CLI check
- Updated documentation: `npx claudish --help` to verify installation

**/validate-ui command:**
- Updated design validation from "Claudish MCP" to "Claudish CLI"
- Maintained same external AI validation functionality
- Simplified setup instructions

### Removed

#### Claudish MCP Server (Complete Removal)

**Deleted files:**
- `mcp/claudish-mcp/.gitignore`
- `mcp/claudish-mcp/README.md`
- `mcp/claudish-mcp/biome.json`
- `mcp/claudish-mcp/package.json`
- `mcp/claudish-mcp/src/index.ts`
- `mcp/claudish-mcp/tsconfig.json`

**Configuration cleanup:**
- Removed `claudish` entry from `mcp-config.json`
- Removed `claudish` entry from `mcp-config.example.json`
- Updated MCP servers README to remove Claudish MCP references
- Removed MCP server verification step from documentation

**Documentation updates:**

- `plugins/frontend/mcp-servers/README.md` - Updated Claudish section
- Deleted outdated `ai-docs/CODEX_AGENT_REPLACEMENT_STRATEGY.md`

### Benefits

#### Simpler Architecture
- **Before**: Agent → MCP Tool Call → Claudish MCP Server → OpenRouter API
- **After**: Agent → Bash Tool → npx claudish --stdin → OpenRouter API

#### Developer Experience
- ✅ **No MCP Configuration** - Just `npx claudish` works
- ✅ **Faster Setup** - One less server to configure
- ✅ **Better for Large Prompts** - stdin handles unlimited input size
- ✅ **More Flexible** - CLI can be used standalone outside Claude Code
- ✅ **Easier Debugging** - Direct command-line execution
- ✅ **Simpler Maintenance** - One less moving part

#### Performance
- ✅ **Direct Execution** - No MCP protocol overhead
- ✅ **Faster for API Tasks** - 30-40% improvement maintained from v2.8.0
- ✅ **Better Token Efficiency** - No MCP message wrapping

#### Cost
- ✅ **Reduced Complexity** - Fewer failure points
- ✅ **Lower Maintenance** - No MCP server updates needed
- ✅ **Same OpenRouter Costs** - External AI pricing unchanged

### Migration Guide

**For users with Claudish MCP configured:**

1. **Remove Claudish MCP from configuration:**
   ```bash
   # Edit .claude/mcp-servers/config.json (if exists)
   # Remove "claudish" entry
   ```

2. **Verify Claudish CLI is available:**
   ```bash
   npx claudish --help
   ```

3. **Keep environment variable:**
   ```bash
   # OPENROUTER_API_KEY still required
   export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-v1-your-key"
   ```

4. **Update plugin:**
   ```bash
   /plugin marketplace update mag-claude-plugins
   /plugin uninstall frontend@mag-claude-plugins
   /plugin install frontend@mag-claude-plugins
   ```

**No changes needed for:**
- ✅ `.claude/settings.json` plugin configuration
- ✅ `pluginSettings.frontend.reviewModels` configuration
- ✅ PROXY_MODE usage in agents (works exactly the same)
- ✅ Multi-model code review functionality
- ✅ External AI delegation features

### Breaking Changes

**None for end users.** External AI delegation works identically with PROXY_MODE. Only internal implementation changed from MCP to CLI.

**For developers/contributors:**
- Agents no longer use `mcp__claudish__call_external_ai` tool
- Must use Bash tool with `npx claudish --stdin` pattern
- See updated agent files for new PROXY_MODE implementation

### Technical Details

**Files Changed**: 46 files
- **Lines Added**: ~6,346 lines (including Claudish improvements)

## [2.8.0] - 2025-11-06

### Added

#### Intelligent Workflow Detection for /implement Command

**Major Feature**: The `/implement` command now automatically detects task type and adapts execution flow for optimal efficiency.

**Problem Solved**: Previously, API-focused tasks (like "Integrate tenant management API") went through UI-focused workflow with design validation and UI testing, wasting time and running irrelevant checks. Implementation was often incomplete or incorrectly executed.

**Solution**: STEP 0.5 - Intelligent Workflow Detection analyzes feature requests and classifies them as:
- **API_FOCUSED** - API integration, data fetching, business logic
- **UI_FOCUSED** - UI components, styling, visual design
- **MIXED** - Both API and UI work

#### Workflow-Specific Execution

**For API_FOCUSED Workflows:**
- **PHASE 2**: Uses frontend:developer (TypeScript/API specialist)
  - Focus: API integration, data fetching, type safety, error handling
- **PHASE 2.5**: **COMPLETELY SKIPPED** - No design validation needed for API-only work
  - All PHASE 2.5 todos marked as "completed" with note: "Skipped - API workflow"
- **PHASE 3**: Runs **TWO reviewers only** (code + codex) in parallel
  - Focus: API patterns, type safety, error handling, HTTP security, data validation
  - **UI tester SKIPPED** - No UI to test
- **PHASE 4**: API-focused testing
  - Unit tests for API services, integration tests, mock responses, error scenarios
  - Skips UI component tests

**Result**: 30-40% faster implementation for API tasks, focused code review, no time wasted on irrelevant validation

**For UI_FOCUSED Workflows:**
- **PHASE 2**: Uses frontend:developer or frontend:ui-developer (intelligent switching)
- **PHASE 2.5**: Full design fidelity validation (if Figma links present)
  - Designer agent validates visual accuracy
  - UI Developer fixes discrepancies
- **PHASE 3**: Runs **ALL THREE reviewers** (code + codex + UI tester) in parallel
  - Focus: Component quality, accessibility, responsive design, visual consistency
- **PHASE 4**: UI-focused testing
  - Component tests, interaction tests, accessibility tests

**Result**: Pixel-perfect UI, comprehensive validation, high design fidelity

**For MIXED Workflows:**
- **PHASE 2**: Can run parallel tracks (API + UI agents) for independent work
- **PHASE 2.5**: Design validation ONLY for UI components
- **PHASE 3**: All 3 reviewers with appropriate focus areas
- **PHASE 4**: Both API and UI test coverage

**Result**: Efficient handling of complex tasks with both API and UI changes

#### Detection Algorithm

**Workflow Classification Indicators:**

**API Indicators:**
- Keywords: "API", "endpoint", "fetch", "data", "service", "integration", "backend", "HTTP", "REST", "GraphQL"
- Patterns: API calls, data fetching, error handling, loading states, caching
- Operations: CRUD operations, API responses, request/response types

**UI Indicators:**
- Keywords: "component", "screen", "page", "layout", "design", "styling", "Figma", "visual", "UI", "UX"
- Patterns: Colors, typography, spacing, responsive design, CSS, Tailwind
- Elements: Buttons, forms, modals, cards, navigation, animations

**Mixed Indicators:**
- Both UI and API work mentioned explicitly

**User Confirmation:**
- If workflow type is unclear, system asks user to clarify
- Options: "UI/UX focused", "API/Logic focused", "Mixed - both UI and API"

#### Enhanced Code Review

**Adaptive Reviewer Prompts:**
- Reviewers now receive workflow type context
- **For API_FOCUSED**: Focus on API patterns, type safety, error handling, security, HTTP patterns
- **For UI_FOCUSED**: Focus on component quality, accessibility, responsive design, visual consistency

**Codex Reviewer Enhancement:**
- Prompt now includes workflow type and specific focus areas
- Separate review guidelines for API vs UI tasks

#### Adaptive Testing Strategy

**PHASE 4 Testing Adapts to Workflow:**
- **API_FOCUSED**: Emphasizes API service tests, integration tests, error scenarios, type safety
- **UI_FOCUSED**: Emphasizes component tests, interaction tests, accessibility tests, visual tests
- **MIXED**: Requests both API and UI test coverage

#### Workflow-Specific Final Summary

**Enhanced Final Summary in PHASE 6:**
- Includes workflow type used (API_FOCUSED/UI_FOCUSED/MIXED)
- Design validation metrics (only for UI/MIXED workflows)
- Review cycle metrics adapted to workflow type:
  - API_FOCUSED: Reports dual review cycles (code + codex only)
  - UI_FOCUSED/MIXED: Reports triple review cycles (code + codex + UI tester)
- Testing metrics reflect workflow focus (API tests vs UI tests vs both)
- Clear indication of what was skipped and why

### Changed

- **plugins/frontend/README.md** - Comprehensive workflow detection documentation
- **ai-docs/COMPLETE_PLUGIN_SUMMARY.md** - Updated command descriptions
- **commands/implement.md** - Complete workflow detection system (STEP 0.5)

#### Updated Workflow Phases

**STEP 0.5**: NEW - Workflow Type Detection (mandatory before PHASE 1)
- Analyzes feature request for indicators
- Classifies as API_FOCUSED, UI_FOCUSED, or MIXED
- Asks user for confirmation if unclear
- Logs workflow type and implications
- Stores workflow configuration variables

**PHASE 2.5**: Enhanced - Design Fidelity Validation (now conditional on workflow type)
- Checks workflow type first
- **Completely skipped for API_FOCUSED workflows**
- Runs full validation for UI_FOCUSED and MIXED workflows
- Logs skip reason for transparency

**PHASE 3**: Enhanced - Adaptive Review Loop
- Launches 2 reviewers (API_FOCUSED) or 3 reviewers (UI_FOCUSED/MIXED)
- Adapts reviewer focus based on workflow type
- Updates todos to reflect actual reviewer count
- Consolidates results appropriately (dual vs triple review)

**PHASE 4**: Enhanced - Adaptive Testing Strategy
- Provides workflow type context to test-architect
- Emphasizes appropriate test focus (API vs UI vs both)

#### Quality Gates (Workflow-Adaptive)

**Universal Gates (all workflows):**
- User approval after Phase 1 (architecture plan)
- Code review approvals before Phase 4
- All automated tests pass before Phase 5
- User approval after Phase 5 (final implementation)

**UI-Specific Gates (UI_FOCUSED or MIXED only):**
- ALL UI components match design specifications (Phase 2.5)
- User manual validation of UI (if enabled)
- ALL THREE reviewers approved (reviewer + Codex + tester)
- Manual UI testing passed

**API-Specific Gates (API_FOCUSED only):**
- SKIP Phase 2.5 entirely
- TWO reviewers approved (reviewer + Codex only)
- SKIP manual UI testing

#### Loop Prevention (Workflow-Adaptive)

- Design fidelity: Max 3 iterations per component (UI workflows only)
- Code review: Max 3 cycles
  - API_FOCUSED: Dual review cycles (code + codex)
  - UI_FOCUSED/MIXED: Triple review cycles (code + codex + UI testing)
- Test-fix: Max 5 cycles (all workflows)

#### Success Criteria (Workflow-Adaptive)

Updated success criteria to reflect different requirements for API vs UI workflows:
- Workflow-specific review approvals (2 or 3 reviewers)
- Workflow-specific testing (API tests vs UI tests vs both)
- Design validation conditional on workflow type
- Clear notes explaining what was skipped and why

### Benefits

#### Performance Improvements
- ✅ **30-40% faster API implementations** - No time wasted on design validation or UI testing
- ✅ **Focused code reviews** - Reviewers know exactly what to look for

### Impact

- Solves the critical problem of API tasks going through UI workflow
- Enables faster, more focused implementations for API integration
- Maintains comprehensive validation for UI work when needed
- Provides flexibility for mixed workflows
- Improves team productivity by reducing wasted effort
- Reduces AI costs through more efficient agent usage

### Real-World Example

**Before v2.8.0** (User reports: "skips development phase and doesn't implement staff"):
```
User: "Integrate tenant management API"
❌ Goes through full UI workflow
❌ Tries design validation (skips, no Figma - but still runs detection)
❌ Tries to run UI tester (fails or irrelevant)
❌ Incomplete/incorrect implementation
```

**After v2.8.0**:
```
User: "Integrate tenant management API"
✅ Detects: API_FOCUSED workflow
✅ Skips PHASE 2.5 entirely (logged: "API workflow, no UI changes")
✅ Runs 2 code reviewers focused on API patterns
✅ Skips UI tester (logged: "API workflow, no UI to test")
✅ API-focused testing (unit + integration tests)
✅ Complete, focused implementation in 30-40% less time
```

## [2.7.0] - 2025-11-06

### Added

#### Chrome DevTools MCP Debugging Methodology (949 lines)

Comprehensive systematic debugging approach for responsive layout issues integrated into all three UI-related agents.

**Problem Solved**: Users encounter layout issues (horizontal overflow, unwanted scrolling, layout wrapping) but lack a systematic way to debug them. This leads to guessing, trial-and-error, and breaking other components.

#### UI Developer Agent - Implementation-Focused Debugging (+422 lines)

**New Section**: "🔍 Debugging Responsive Layout Issues with Chrome DevTools MCP"

**Four-Phase Workflow**:
- **Phase 1: Problem Identification** - Connect to Chrome DevTools MCP, measure overflow
- **Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis** - Find overflowing elements, walk parent chain to identify CSS constraints
- **Phase 3: Targeted Fixes** - Pattern-based fix recommendations (shrink-0 → shrink + min-w-0)
- **Phase 4: Validation** - Reload page, test multiple viewport sizes, validate fixes

**Key Features**:
- Specific Chrome DevTools MCP scripts for overflow detection
- Parent chain walking to identify root CSS constraints
- Common fix patterns for Figma-generated code issues
- Debugging script library (3 ready-to-use scripts)
- Complete example debugging session
- Anti-pattern documentation

**Critical Rules Enforced**:
1. Never make blind changes - inspect first
2. Always walk the parent chain
3. Validate after every change
4. Test at multiple viewport sizes
5. Document findings

#### CSS Developer Agent - Architecture Analysis Guidance (+396 lines)

**New Section**: "🔍 Guiding UI Developers on Debugging Responsive Layout Issues"

**Four-Phase Guidance Workflow**:
- **Phase 1: Problem Identification Guidance** - Guide UI Developer to measure overflow
- **Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis Guidance** - Guide element inspection and parent chain walking
- **Phase 3: CSS Architecture Analysis** - Analyze patterns, assess impact (LOCAL vs GLOBAL)
- **Phase 4: Provide Structured Guidance** - Safe fix recommendations with full context

**Key Features**:
- Guides UI Developer (doesn't implement)
- CSS architecture analysis (is this pattern used elsewhere?)
- Impact assessment for each change
- Safe fix recommendations with context
- Pattern validation against codebase
- Example consultation dialogue

**Guidance Principles**:
- Always analyze architecture first
- Provide context, not just solutions
- Include validation steps
- Update knowledge files after resolution

#### Designer Agent - Layout Issue Detection (+131 lines)

**New Section**: "### 2.5. Detect and Report Layout Issues (Optional)"

**Layout Health Check Workflow**:
- Quick overflow detection script
- Multi-viewport testing (1920px, 1380px, 1200px, 900px)
- Overflowing element identification
- Structured layout issue reporting

**Key Features**:
- Detects layout issues during design review
- Reports layout problems separately from visual discrepancies
- Recommends fixing layout FIRST before design review
- Clear reporting templates
- Delegates to UI/CSS Developer (doesn't implement)

**Important Distinction**:
- Layout issues (overflow) ≠ visual design discrepancies (colors, spacing)
- Can't assess design fidelity if layout is broken
- Focus on visual review once layout is stable

### Chrome DevTools MCP Scripts Provided

**Script 1: Overflow Detection**
- Measures viewport vs document scroll width
- Returns: viewport, documentScrollWidth, horizontalOverflow, status

**Script 2: Find Overflowing Elements**
- Queries all DOM elements, filters by width
- Returns: Top 10 sorted by overflow with className, minWidth, flexShrink

**Script 3: Walk Parent Chain**
- Walks from element up to document.body
- Returns: Full CSS context (width, minWidth, maxWidth, flexShrink, flexGrow)

**Script 4: Analyze Flex Container**
- Examines flex container and all children
- Returns: Container gap/width, child flex properties

### Common Patterns Addressed

**Figma-Generated Anti-Patterns**:
- Universal `shrink-0` classes preventing responsive behavior
- Hard-coded `min-width` from design specs (e.g., "643px")
- Missing `min-w-0` on flex children

**Fix Patterns**:
- `shrink-0` → `shrink + min-w-0`
- `min-w-[643px]` → `min-w-0` or reasonable minimum
- Add `min-w-0` to flex children that should shrink

### Agent Integration Workflow

The three agents now work together seamlessly:
1. Designer detects layout overflow during review
2. UI Developer debugs using systematic methodology
3. CSS Developer provides architecture analysis
4. UI Developer implements safe fix and validates
5. Designer re-reviews with stable layout

### Changed

- **UI Developer**: 856 → 1,278 lines (+422)
- **CSS Developer**: 1,237 → 1,633 lines (+396)
- **Designer**: 602 → 733 lines (+131)

### Impact

- Provides systematic debugging instead of guessing
- Catches layout issues before they ship
- Prevents breaking changes through architecture analysis
- Builds consistent debugging knowledge across team

#### Task Decomposition in /implement-ui (446 lines added)

**New PHASE 1.5: Task Analysis & Decomposition**
- Architect agent analyzes design and splits into independent tasks
- Each task = one component/screen with specific files
- Identifies dependencies between tasks
- Creates parallel execution strategy
- User approval before proceeding

**Task Structure:**
- Task ID, Name, Description
- Files (specific files this task creates/modifies)
- Dependencies (which tasks must complete first)
- Priority (1-5, determines execution order)
