## [2.6.1] - 2025-11-06

### Added

#### CVA Best Practices for shadcn/ui
- **Comprehensive CVA guidance** added to CSS Developer and UI Developer agents
  - Type-safe component variant patterns
  - Decision trees for className vs variant props
  - When to add CVA variants vs use className overrides
  - Troubleshooting common CVA issues
  - Documentation templates for CVA components

#### CSS Developer Agent - CVA Section (400+ lines)
- **Critical CVA Rules:**
  - NEVER use !important with CVA components
  - Don't create separate CSS classes for variants (breaks type system)
  - Always add new variants to CVA definition for reusable styles
  - Use className prop for one-off customizations only
  - Let twMerge (via cn()) handle class conflicts

- **Decision Tree for Custom Styling:**
  - One-off customization → Use className prop
  - Reusable style (3+ uses) → Add CVA variant
  - Modifies existing variant slightly → className prop override
  - Completely different style → Add CVA variant

- **Step-by-Step Variant Addition Guide**
- **3 Detailed Consultation Scenarios**
- **Troubleshooting Guide** (variant conflicts, TypeScript errors)
- **CVA Knowledge Documentation Templates**

#### UI Developer Agent - CVA Integration
- **Red Flags** triggering CSS Developer consultation
- **Golden Rule**: Work with CVA, don't fight it
- **Decision Tree** for when to consult CSS Developer
- **2 Detailed Consultation Examples**
- **Clear Guidelines** on what CSS Developer provides

## [2.6.0] - 2025-11-06

### Added

#### CSS-Aware Design Validation
- **DOM Inspection** - Designers now inspect actual rendered elements via Chrome DevTools MCP
- **Computed CSS Analysis** - Get real browser-computed styles (actual values, not just class names)
- **CSS Rule Identification** - See which CSS rules and Tailwind classes are applied
- **Pattern Awareness** - Consult CSS Developer to understand existing patterns before suggesting fixes
- **Safe Fix Recommendations** - Impact assessment (LOCAL/GLOBAL) for each suggested change

#### Enhanced Designer Agent (290+ lines added)

**New 5-Step Workflow:**
1. **Capture Screenshot & Inspect DOM** - Get computed styles for all major elements
2. **Consult CSS Developer for Context** - Understand patterns, tokens, and standard classes
3. **CSS-Aware Design Review** - Compare design vs actual computed CSS values
4. **Consult CSS Developer for Safe Fixes** - Verify each fix won't break other components
5. **Generate CSS-Aware Report** - Include computed CSS, pattern analysis, impact assessment

**Report Enhancements:**
- 🖥️ **Computed CSS Analysis** - Actual padding, colors, fonts from browser
- 🧩 **CSS Developer Insights** - Pattern compliance, standard usage locations
- ⚠️ **CSS-Analyzed Discrepancies** - Expected vs Actual with CSS rules and classes
- 🎯 **CSS Developer Approved Fixes** - Safe changes with impact assessment

#### Enhanced Designer-Codex Agent
- Now receives computed CSS properties for accurate validation
- Gets CSS Developer insights about patterns and impact
- Enables more precise Codex AI recommendations

### Benefits

- ✅ **No More Guessing** - "padding: 8px 16px (computed from px-4 py-2)" vs "the button looks wrong"
- ✅ **Understand WHY** - See which classes/rules cause the visual differences
- ✅ **Safe Fixes** - Know if changing affects 1 component or 26 components
- ✅ **Pattern Awareness** - Align with existing patterns (26 files use bg-blue-600)
- ✅ **Prevent Breaking Changes** - "LOCAL - Only affects this component ✅"

### Changed

## [2.5.0] - 2025-11-06

### Added

#### CSS Developer Agent (NEW - 879 lines)
- **CSS Architecture Knowledge Management**
  - Creates and maintains `.ai-docs/css-knowledge/` directory
  - 7 knowledge files: README, design-tokens, component-patterns, utility-patterns, element-rules, global-styles, change-log
  - Tracks what CSS patterns exist and where they're used
  - Documents design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
  - Component pattern registry with usage locations
  - Prevents breaking changes via impact analysis

- **Modern CSS + Tailwind CSS 4 Best Practices (2025):**
  - CSS-first configuration with @theme
  - Container queries for component-responsive design
  - :has() pseudo-class for parent/sibling selection
  - CSS cascade layers for predictable specificity
  - Performance: 5x faster full builds, 100x faster incremental
  - Strategic @apply usage (only for true component abstraction)
  - Mobile-first responsive design
  - WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance

- **Change Impact Assessment:**
  - HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW risk levels
  - Analyzes how many files affected by CSS changes
  - Migration plans for global CSS modifications
  - Safe vs unsafe change guidelines

- **UI Developer Integration:**
  - MANDATORY consultation before CSS changes
  - Step-by-step consultation process
  - Examples of safe vs unsafe changes
  - Explicit approval required for global changes

#### Task Decomposition in /implement-ui (446 lines added)

**New PHASE 1.5: Task Analysis & Decomposition**
- Architect agent analyzes design and splits into independent tasks
- Each task = one component/screen with specific files
- Identifies dependencies between tasks
- Creates parallel execution strategy
- User approval before proceeding

**Task Structure:**
- Task ID, Name, Description
- Files (specific files this task creates/modifies)
- Dependencies (which tasks must complete first)
- Priority (1-5, determines execution order)
- Design Section (specific part of design)
- Complexity (low/medium/high)

**Parallel Execution Strategy:**
- Tasks with no dependencies run in PARALLEL (Round 1)
- Tasks with dependencies wait for prerequisites (Round 2+)
- Each task modifies DIFFERENT files (no overlap)
- Changes to Task A can't break Task B (isolation)

**Per-Task Validation Loops:**
- Each task gets focused validation loop (max 5 iterations)
- Validates ONLY that task's component/screen
- Designer agents focus on specific design section and files
- Prevents "fix Component A, break Component B" problem

### Changed

- **UI Developer Agent** - Added CSS Developer consultation workflow (136+ lines)
  - When to consult CSS Developer
  - How to request CSS architecture analysis
  - Examples of consultation scenarios

- **Version Updates:**
  - Frontend Plugin: 2.4.1 → 2.5.0
