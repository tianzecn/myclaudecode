## 🏆 Stop Wasting Time. Ship Like the Top 1%.

**While you're fighting with AI prompts, elite teams are shipping 3x faster.**

At [tianzecn](https://madappgang.com) and [10xLabs](https://10xlabs.com.au), we don't do "good enough." We're the teams that Fortune 500 companies hire when their own developers can't deliver. We architect platforms processing **$50M+ in annual transactions**. We scale systems to **500,000+ concurrent users**. We ship features that make or break businesses.

**Here's what separates us:** While most developers adopt new tools, we **engineer competitive advantages**.

When Claude Code launched, we didn't experiment—we **weaponized it into production workflows** that have:

⚡ **Generated $2.3M in value** through faster time-to-market on enterprise contracts
⚡ **Eliminated 156+ hours per sprint** of repetitive development work
⚡ **Shipped 47 major features** to production with zero rollbacks
⚡ **Scaled to 23-person engineering teams** without losing velocity
⚡ **Cut AI token costs by 40%** while improving output quality by 60%

### The Brutal Truth About AI Development

**Most developers are doing AI-assisted development wrong.**

They're copying prompts from Reddit. Following tutorials from people who've never shipped to production. Using workflows that optimize for demos, not delivery.

**The cost?** Weeks of wasted time. Features that ship broken. AI bills that balloon. Teams that slow down instead of speed up.

### What You Get: Production-Grade Workflows That Actually Ship

Every single workflow in these plugins was **forged in the fire of real deadlines**, real users, and real revenue. Not built for GitHub stars. Built to **win contracts and crush competitors**.

#### The Stack That Ships

**We don't use "good enough" tools. We use the tools that win.**

- 🔥 **Tailwind CSS 4 & React 19** - Latest stable releases, not outdated patterns from 2023
- 🔥 **Semantic code search** - 40% token reduction = **$1,200/month saved** on AI costs for mid-size teams
- 🔥 **8-phase implementation workflows** - The exact process that shipped features to **half a million users**
- 🔥 **MCP-powered integrations** - Figma → Code → Browser Testing → Production in one command
- 🔥 **Zero-config team synchronization** - One file. Entire team aligned. No more "works on my machine"

#### What This Actually Means for You

**Stop burning cash on inefficient AI usage.** Our semantic search optimization alone has saved our teams **$14,000+ annually** in API costs.

**Stop shipping buggy code.** Our multi-stage review system (manual + AI + browser testing) catches 89% of bugs before they hit production.

**Stop reinventing workflows.** These plugins encode **2,500+ hours** of workflow optimization that you get in 60 seconds.

### The Choice Is Simple

**Option A:** Keep experimenting with generic AI prompts, watching your competitors ship faster, burning budget on trial-and-error.

**Option B:** Use the exact workflows that elite teams use to **build products worth millions**.

These aren't "best practices" from blog posts. This is the **battle-tested playbook** that ships features to Fortune 500 clients, scales to hundreds of thousands of users, and wins against competitors with 10x your budget.

**This is how the top 1% actually builds software in 2025.**

**The `/implement` Workflow with Intelligent Detection:**

The star feature is the `/implement` command—now with intelligent workflow detection that automatically adapts based on your task:

**For API Integration Tasks** (e.g., "Integrate user management API"):
- Skips design validation (PHASE 2.5) entirely
- Runs 2 code reviewers (manual + AI) focused on API patterns
- Skips UI testing - focuses on API service tests
- **Result**: Faster implementation, no wasted time on irrelevant UI checks

**For UI Implementation Tasks** (e.g., "Build UserProfile component"):
1. **Architecture Planning** → Designs solution, asks questions, gets approval
2. **Implementation** → Generates code following project patterns
2.5. **Design Fidelity Validation** → CSS-aware validation if Figma links present
3. **Triple Review** → Manual review + AI analysis + browser testing
4. **Test Generation** → UI-focused test suites
5. **User Approval** → Final review gate
6. **Cleanup** → Removes temporary artifacts
7. **Delivery** → Production-ready feature with documentation
- **Result**: Pixel-perfect UI, comprehensive validation

**For Mixed Tasks** (both API and UI):
- Combines both workflows with appropriate focus areas
- Design validation for UI parts only
- All 3 reviewers with targeted focus
- Both API and UI test coverage

**Perfect for:** React/TypeScript teams, TanStack ecosystem, API-driven apps, Figma workflows, shadcn/ui projects, pixel-perfect UI implementation, production-ready code quality

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

**Claude Code Requirements:**
- Claude Code version with plugin system support
- Plugin manifest location: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (required)
- Settings format: `enabledPlugins` must be object with boolean values:
  ```json
  {
    "enabledPlugins": {
      "plugin-name@marketplace-name": true
    }
  }
  ```

**System Requirements:**
- Claude Code installed and configured
- Git access to GitHub

### Recommended Setup: Global Marketplace + Per-Project Plugins

This approach gives you the best of both worlds: marketplace installed once globally, plugins enabled individually per project.

#### Step 1: Add Marketplace Globally (One-Time Setup)

Each developer on your team does this once:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add tianzecn/myclaudecode
```

This registers the MAG Claude Plugins marketplace in your Claude Code installation. You only need to do this once, and it works for all your projects.

#### Step 2: Enable Plugins in Your Project

Add or edit `.claude/settings.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "frontend@tianzecn-plugins": true
  }
}
```

**Commit this file to git:**

```bash
git add .claude/settings.json
git commit -m "Enable MAG Claude plugins for this project"
git push
```

#### Step 3: Team Members Get Automatic Setup

When team members who have added the marketplace (Step 1) pull your project, Claude Code automatically:

1. Detects the enabled plugins
2. Installs them for this project
3. Activates them immediately

**No manual installation needed!**

#### Why This Approach?

✅ **One-time marketplace setup** - Add the marketplace once, use in all projects
✅ **Per-project plugin control** - Each project specifies its own plugins
✅ **Team consistency** - Everyone gets the same plugins automatically
✅ **Version controlled** - Plugin configuration committed with your code
✅ **No environment drift** - All team members have identical plugin setup
✅ **Project isolation** - Plugins only active where you need them

#### Multiple Plugins

Need more than one plugin? Just add more entries:

```json
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "frontend@tianzecn-plugins": true,
    "code-analysis@tianzecn-plugins": true,
    "bun@tianzecn-plugins": true,
    "orchestration@tianzecn-plugins": true
  }
}
```

---

### Verify Installation

After setup, verify everything works:

```bash
# Check for any errors
/doctor

# List installed plugins
/plugin list

# Should show:
# frontend@tianzecn-plugins (project-specific)
#   Version: 1.2.0
#   Status: ✓ Loaded
```

**Common issues:**
- If `/doctor` shows errors, see [Troubleshooting](#-troubleshooting) below
- If plugin not listed, ensure marketplace was added in Step 1
- Plugin activates automatically when you open a project with `.claude/settings.json`

---

## 📚 Usage Guide

### Quick Start

Once installed, plugins work seamlessly with Claude Code:

**Agents** are automatically invoked by Claude when appropriate, or you can request them explicitly.

**Slash Commands** provide powerful one-line workflows for common tasks.

**Skills** enhance Claude's capabilities and are automatically used when relevant.

### Example: Full-Cycle Feature Implementation

```bash
/implement Create a user profile page with avatar upload and bio editing
```

This single command:
1. Plans the architecture and gets your approval
2. Implements all components following your project patterns
3. Reviews code with 3 different approaches (human + AI + browser)
4. Generates comprehensive tests
5. Cleans up artifacts
6. Delivers production-ready code with documentation

**Result:** Complete feature in minutes, not hours.

### Example: Import Figma Design

```bash
/import-figma NavigationBar
```

Fetches your Figma component, adapts it to your codebase, installs dependencies, and opens it in browser for validation.
