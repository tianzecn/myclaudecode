<instructions>
  <critical_constraints>
    <orchestrator_role mandatory="true">
      **STRICT Orchestrator Pattern Enforcement:**

      You MUST:
      - Use Task tool to delegate ALL data manipulation to agents
      - Use AskUserQuestion for user approval gate
      - Use Bash for running sync script and git commands
      - Use Read for file verification only
      - Use Glob/Grep for finding files

      You MUST NOT:
      - Use Write or Edit tools directly
      - Perform filtering, categorization, or file updates yourself
      - Manipulate data structures
      - Only coordinate workflow and make decisions about delegation

      **Rationale:** Orchestrators coordinate but never manipulate data. All data operations
      must be delegated to specialized agents with appropriate tool permissions.
    </orchestrator_role>

    <todowrite_requirement>
      You MUST use the TodoWrite tool to create and maintain a todo list throughout your orchestration workflow.

      **Before starting**, create a todo list with all 5 phases:
      1. PHASE 0: Initialization
      2. PHASE 1: Scrape and Filter Models
      3. PHASE 2: User Approval
      4. PHASE 3: Update Shared File
      5. PHASE 4: Sync to Plugins

      **Update continuously**:
      - Mark tasks as "in_progress" when starting
      - Mark tasks as "completed" immediately after finishing
      - Keep only ONE task as "in_progress" at a time
    </todowrite_requirement>

    <delegation_contract mandatory="true">
      **Strict Delegation Rules:**

      - ALL scraping → model-scraper agent
      - ALL filtering/deduplication/categorization → model-scraper agent
      - ALL file updates → model-scraper agent
      - Orchestrator only: coordinates, validates, approves, recovers from errors

      **Never violate this contract.** If you find yourself about to use Write/Edit,
      STOP and delegate to model-scraper instead.
    </delegation_contract>

    <user_approval_gate mandatory="true">
      You MUST present filtered model list to user before updating:

      - Show: model IDs, providers, categories, pricing
      - Allow user to: approve, modify, or reject
      - Do NOT proceed without approval
      - Support structured modification input (see knowledge section)
    </user_approval_gate>
  </critical_constraints>

  <core_principles>
    <principle name="Strict Orchestration Pattern" priority="critical">
      - Orchestrator coordinates but never manipulates data
      - All data operations delegated to specialized agents
      - Clear separation of concerns: orchestration vs implementation
      - Tool restrictions enforced: NO Write/Edit in orchestrator
    </principle>

    <principle name="Context-Aware Filtering" priority="high">
      Provide these filtering rules to model-scraper agent:

      1. **Anthropic Filter**: Exclude all Anthropic models (Claude available natively)
      2. **Provider Deduplication**: Max 1 per provider (keep top-ranked)
      3. **Category Balance**: Min 2 models per category (coding, reasoning, vision, budget)
      4. **Target Count**: 9-12 models
      5. **Diversity**: ≥5 different providers

      **Category Balance Override:**
      - If category has <2 models after deduplication, allow 2nd model from that provider
      - Priority: Category diversity > Provider deduplication
    </principle>

    <principle name="Safe Updates" priority="high">
      - Always read existing file first for verification
      - Create backup before sync
      - Rollback on any failure
      - Preserve existing file if update fails
      - User approval required before modifications
    </principle>

    <principle name="Error Recovery with Retry Limits" priority="high">
      - Handle scraping failures gracefully (max 3 attempts)
      - Rollback on sync script errors
      - Partial sync recovery (continue with successful, retry failures)
      - Log all errors for debugging
      - User decision gates for ambiguous failures

      <steps>
        <step>Launch model-scraper agent via Task tool with filtering rules:
          ```
          Prompt: "Scrape trending programming models from OpenRouter and apply these filters:

          **CRITICAL: Tiered Pricing Handling**
          - See shared/TIERED_PRICING_SPEC.md for complete specification
          - If model has tiered pricing (e.g., Claude Sonnet: 0-200K vs 200K-1M):
            * Calculate average price for EACH tier
            * Select tier with LOWEST average price
            * Use that tier's MAXIMUM context (NOT full model capacity!)
            * Record tier metadata (tiered: true, note about pricing)
          - Example: Claude Sonnet (200K/$9 tier vs 1M/$90 tier) → record as $9/1M, 200K context
          - Never average prices across tiers (misleading!)

          **Filtering Rules:**
          - Exclude providers: anthropic (Claude models available natively)
          - Max per provider: 1 (keep top-ranked only for diversity)
          - Min per category: 2 (ensure category balance)
          - Target count: 9-12 models

          **Category Focus:**
          - Fast coding models (low latency, high throughput)
          - Advanced reasoning models (complex problem-solving)
          - Vision-capable models (multimodal)
          - Budget-friendly options (cost-effective)

          **Deduplication Algorithm:**
          1. Filter: Remove all Anthropic models
          2. Group by provider: Extract provider from slug (provider/model-name)
          3. Deduplicate: Keep ONLY top-ranked model per provider (first in list)
             - Ranking = OpenRouter's inherent sort order (most popular first)
          4. Category balance: Count models per category
             - If category has <2 models, consider re-adding 2nd model from that provider
             - Priority: Under-represented categories > provider deduplication
          5. Limit: If >12 models, remove lowest-ranked budget models first

          **Return:**
          - JSON array of filtered models with: slug, provider, category, pricing, context, rank
          - Summary of filtering (original count, filtered count, models removed)

        **Retry Limits (Max 3 Attempts):**

        - **Attempt 2:** If still <7 models, retry with relaxed filters (allow 2 per provider)
        - **Attempt 3:** If still fails, ask user:
          * Option A: Use existing recommendations (preserve current file, no update)
          * Option B: Proceed with fewer models (if ≥5 models available)
          * Option C: Abort workflow
        - **Max retries:** 3 attempts total

        **Scraping Failure Behavior:**
        - If Chrome DevTools MCP error: Report error, suggest MCP configuration check
        - If page structure changed: Report error, suggest manual verification
        - If network issues: Report error, suggest retry later

    <capabilities>
      The model-scraper agent is responsible for:

      1. **Scraping** - Extract model data from OpenRouter rankings
      2. **Filtering** - Apply filtering rules provided by orchestrator:
         - Remove Anthropic models
         - Deduplicate by provider (keep top-ranked per provider)
         - Balance categories (ensure diversity)
         - Limit to 9-12 models
      3. **Categorization** - Assign categories (coding, reasoning, vision, budget)
      4. **File Updates** - Update BOTH files:

         **A) Markdown File (shared/recommended-models.md):**
         - Quick Reference Table
         - Model entries per category
         - Performance Benchmarks
         - Version increment (patch)
         - Last Updated date

         **B) JSON File (mcp/claudish/recommended-models.json):**
         - Create/overwrite JSON file for Claudish runtime
         - Extract model metadata (id, name, provider, category, priority, pricing, context)
         - Include version and lastUpdated fields
         - Sort by priority (1 = highest)
         - Mark recommended models (⭐ in Quick Reference)
    </capabilities>

    <input_format>
      Task prompt with:
      - Target URL (OpenRouter rankings)
      - Filtering rules:

        * min_per_category: 2
        * target_count: 9-12 models
      - Category focus areas
      - File structure preservation rules
    </input_format>

    <output_format>

      ```

      **Clarification on Ranking:**
      - "Rank" = Position in OpenRouter's scraped list (1 = first/top)
      - OpenRouter sorts by popularity/usage metrics
      - "Top-ranked per provider" = First occurrence of that provider in list
    </rule>

    <rule name="Category Balance" priority="3">
      ```yaml
      min_per_category: 2
      categories:
        - coding (fast, low-latency models)
        - reasoning (complex problem-solving)

        # If category has <2 models after deduplication:
        # Consider re-adding 2nd model from under-represented provider
        # Priority: Category diversity > Provider deduplication

      algorithm:
        1. Apply Anthropic filter
        2. Apply provider deduplication (keep top-ranked)
        3. Count models per category
        4. For categories with <2 models:
           - Find providers with removed 2nd-ranked models in that category
           - Re-add highest-ranked removed model from that category
           - Only re-add up to 2 models per provider maximum
        5. Final limit: 12 models (remove lowest-ranked budget models if exceeded)

  <sync_script_behavior>
    The `scripts/sync-shared.ts` script:

    1. Reads `shared/recommended-models.md`
    2. Writes identical copy to each plugin directory:
       - `plugins/frontend/recommended-models.md`
       - `plugins/bun/recommended-models.md`
       - `plugins/code-analysis/recommended-models.md`
    3. Reports success/failure per file with exit codes
    4. Exits with code 0 on complete success, non-zero on any failure
    5. **Does NOT commit changes** - User must commit manually

    **Partial Failure Behavior:**
    - Script may succeed for some files and fail for others
    - Check md5 hashes to identify which files synced successfully
    - Use git status to see which files were modified
  </sync_script_behavior>

  <deduplication_retry_strategy>
    **When deduplication results in too few models (<7):**

    1. **First Retry:** Keep same filters, retry scraping (page may have loaded more models)
    2. **Second Retry:** Relax provider limit (allow 2 per provider)
    3. **Third Retry:** Final attempt with maximum relaxation
    4. **Max Retries Reached:** Ask user to decide:
       - Use existing recommendations (preserve current file)
       - Proceed with fewer models (if ≥5 available)
       - Abort workflow

    **Clarification on "Use Existing":**
    - Preserve current shared/recommended-models.md with no changes
    - Notify user models may be outdated
    - Abort workflow gracefully (no files modified)

## ⚠️ Model Update Aborted (Insufficient Data)

**Phase:** PHASE 1 - Scrape and Filter Models
**Error:** Insufficient models extracted after 3 retry attempts

**Retry History:**
- Attempt 1: 4 models (below minimum 7)
- Attempt 2: 5 models (with relaxed filters)
- Attempt 3: 6 models (final attempt)

**Likely Causes:**
1. Chrome DevTools MCP not responding properly
2. OpenRouter page structure may have changed
3. Network connectivity issues during scraping

**User Decision:** Use existing recommendations (no update)

**Result:** No files were modified. Current recommendations preserved.

**Recommendation:**
1. Check MCP status: Test Chrome DevTools MCP manually
2. Verify page access: Visit https://openrouter.ai/rankings in browser
3. Review logs: Check model-scraper agent output for detailed errors
4. Retry later: Run /update-models again when MCP is stable

**Next Steps:** Fix MCP issues and re-run /update-models

    5. Provide diagnostic steps (check permissions, check script)

    ### Partial Failure (1-2/3 plugins synced)
    1. Identify successful syncs (md5 hash comparison)
    2. Identify failed syncs (different md5 or error)
    3. Ask user:
       - **Continue:** Keep successful syncs, report failures for manual sync
       - **Rollback:** Restore backup + revert all plugin files (use git restore)
       - **Retry:** Attempt sync again for failed plugins only (max 2 retry attempts)
    4. Based on user choice:

       - Manually edit shared file (provide model list for reference)
    3. Explain why limit exists (prevent infinite loops, time management)
    4. Proceed based on user selection
